Repositories
------------
The Lumiera sourcecode is maintained in a distributed fashion through a set of Git repositories.
Each developer has his own repository, but usually developers are working on the same branches;
e.g. you'll certainly find the _master_ branch in each repository. We're fairly liberal when
it comes to giving people an account on +git.lumiera.org+, to allow publishing the individual
developer's work to public repositories. Just ask, maybe explain a bit what you intend to do. +
-> browse our repositories online via link:http://git.lumiera.org/gitweb[Gitweb]

Repository usage pattern
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Developers work locally using Git repositories on their private PC. As a rule: check in often,
publish frequently. Each developer can _pull_ from every repository, but has the right to _push_
just to his own public repository at  +git.lumiera.org+. The ongoing work happens on dedicated
branches. Developers might collaborate by using the same branches. Every working pattern is
possible -- just acknowledge with the others what you're doing.

Eventually, changes and additions get picked up and reviewed by the core developer responsible
for the layer or part of the application in question. This way, code gets merged to the master
branch and pushed to the Lumiera master repository finally. Code seriously breaking existing
unit or integration tests will be kept on hold, until problems are sorted out.

.Mob repository
For small changes, and for the first contributions, there is a _mob repository_ which is
pushable by everyone. Just clone master, do your changes and push to `git://git.lumiera.org/lumiera/mob`


IRC Developer meetings
----------------------
We try to ``meet'' at least once every month in our IRC channel +#lumiera+ on Freenode.net +
Depending on the number of participants and topics to discuss, these meetings are more formal
or informal. 'Everyone is welcome'  -> more about link:meeting[dev meetings].

Design proposals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
For proposals, design plans and basically everything requiring some kind of discussion and agreement,
we have the more formalised *Design Process*: Everyone can write an RfC, using our standard template.
Typically we expect each proponent to participate in some way in the implementation of such a proposal.
These RfC entries will be discussed at the developer meetings and finally accepted or rejected.
