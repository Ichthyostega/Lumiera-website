. Introduction


- History Concept--> events (including possibly meta-events)
- Session: consists of history plus configs
- Similarities to Git: however History probably not implementd in Git
  because....
- Session can be, theoretically, implemented in Git as it is possibly the same concept
- Command --> Event, but Command no Event?
- History contains only events that change state---problem with many commands
  and no state change in history?
- Session must cary Lumiera version and 'know' what to do with different versions, i.e., session from one user using a newer/older version?
- Plugins: installed on one machine produces a session which is replayed on
  another machine with no such plugins?
- One-to-one between command and event? No, one command can effect several
 controls that are treated as group through a placement, so one command will
 effect all members of the placement group. The events for each member of the
- group recieve the same single command, however we can distingiuish between
 each event via the event arguments.
 Example: For example if treple, bass, sound-level are all connteced into a
 single placement group and are attached to a group volume,
changing the group volume will effect all members of the group. We can then, in
 the history, distinguish each group member (trebble, bass, ...) through its
event arguments
- After a rough cut, many clips are relegated to the 'cut-away bin'. This is the
first iteration of the film. In the past, contents from the cut-away bin had
little opportunity of being recast into the final-cut as they were out-of
reviews and were burdened with excessive effort to re-include into the film
edit. Lumiera History will have complete easy access at all times and at all
stages during editing to include such clips.
Support for this feature is possible because Lumiera History is an event based
 mechanism and will be be possible to back track in events, or under reasonable
circumstances, to jump back several events to easily retrieven a clip from the
cut-away bin as these are all recorded and always available from Lumiera
History.
- Events in Lumiera History can be edited: it will be possible to remove events
- It is possible to rebase 2 divergent histories in a mechanism similar to Git
- The Lumiera History cannot simply appear on the GUI as a list of events. It
must be possible to provide meaningful information, i.e, the commands associated
with the exents of more verbose information
- The GUI will not simply support do/undo in the history, rather will be be
 possible to 'jump' to any event in the history list and display and highlight
the entity effected by the event itself.
 - It is also possible to search, select and display a particular event in the history
