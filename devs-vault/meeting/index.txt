We regularly conduct developer meetings -- usually at 2^nd^ Thursday of each month, starting 20^00^ UTC.  
These meetings take place in the IRC channel #lumiera at Freenode. ->link:/project/contact.html[more]

This page announces the next meeting. Usually, meetings are also announced some days ahead
on the Mailinglist. _Everyone is welcome. Feel free to suggest any topic you would like to discuss!_

 * *Summaries* of past meetings can be found ->link:{ldoc}/devel/meeting_summary/index.html[here].

 * If you have been ``volunteered'' to write a summary, you might want
   to have a look at the link:/documentation/devel/template/YYYY-MM-DD-developerMeetingSummary.txt[summary template].


.IRC Transcripts
Deliberately, we won't provide public logs of all our IRC discussions. There needs to be a place
for informal and sometimes controversial discussions. As an exception to this rule, sometimes we save
the literal transcript of an interesting IRC discussion and store an (slightly condensed) excerpt
for later referral ->link:{ldoc}/devel/transcript/index.html[here]

For general discussions or further questions, refer to the ->link:/project/contact.html[Mailing List].

.Topics
Currently most of our meetings are rather informal, since there isn't much to decide
or coordinate. Sometimes, quite involved and technical discussions spring up spontaneously.
Feel free to show up and propose topics for discussion...
