Monthly Meetings
================

We regularly conduct developer meetings on IRC.  The meetings take place in the
IRC channel #lumiera at Freenode.

This page announces the next meeting. _Feel free to suggest any topic you would like to discuss!_

 * The *protocols* for past meetings can be found link:{l}/devs-vault/protocol/index.html[here].

 * If you have been volunteered to write the protocol, you might want to have a look at the link:#[protocol template].

 * For general discussions, see also the http://lists.lumiera.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lumiera[mailing list].
