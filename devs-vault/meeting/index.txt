After a pause, developer meetings have recommenced, but _currently_ at irregular
intervals. Our next meeting will take place in September, 2023, on the
2^nd^ Thursday. We'll periodically meet thereafter on the *2^nd^ Thursday of each
month at 20^00^ UTC*.

Our meeting platform has moved channel from Freenode to Libera.Chat. ->link:/project/contact.html[more]

This page will begin to provide information on meetings. Meetings will not be announced on the
Mailinglist yet, but this may change: we shall announce details here of any
changes. _Everyone is welcome. Feel free to join and participate in any meetings
on the channel!_ 

 * *Summaries* of past meetings can be found ->link:{ldoc}/devel/meeting_summary/index.html[here].

 * If you have been ``volunteered'' to write a summary, you might want
   to have a look at the link:/documentation/devel/template/YYYY-MM-DD-developerMeetingSummary.txt[summary template].


.IRC Transcripts
Deliberately, we won't provide public logs of all our IRC discussions. There needs to be a place
for informal and sometimes controversial discussions. As an exception to this rule, sometimes we save
the literal transcript of an interesting IRC discussion and store an (slightly condensed) excerpt
for later referral ->link:{ldoc}/devel/transcript/index.html[here]

For general discussions or further questions, refer to the ->link:/project/contact.html[Mailing List].
