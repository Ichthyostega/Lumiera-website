=== LUMIERA WEBSITE

Lumiera webisite is meant to live in uWiki (see http://git.pipapo.org/uWiki.html).
Waiting for the uWiki to be usable, so for now, the website is being built with AsciiDoc and git.


=== TEMPORARY WEBSITE

The website pages come from TXT files, written in AsciiDoc markup, committed to the website git repository and converted to HTML with an AsciiDoc script. The pages have two external CSS, one for the layout and one for the content.

Here is the workflow in details:

=== MODIFYING PAGE CONTENT

To edit an HTML webpage, edit its TXT source in your local website git repo and commit it locally.
You must use AsciiDoc markup.
To know a lot about AsciiDoc markup see AsciiDoc website at http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/
An AsciiDoc cheatsheet can be found at http://powerman.name/doc/asciidoc

=== PUSHING TO THE SERVER

Push the changes to lumiera.org.
That will activate 'post-receive', a git hook that automatically checks the files out and run 'build-website.sh', a script that converts the AsciiDoc TXT sources to HTML webpages. 

The full path of the 'post-receive' git hook is:
/var/www/.git/hooks/post-receive

The full path of the 'build-website.sh' script is:
/home/raffa/build-website.sh

The task of the 'build-website.sh' script is to run the asciidoc command to create not just HTML pages but real webpages pointing to external CSS. This script contains the list of TXT files to be converted to HTML webpages.

=== MODIFYING THE STYLE

* To edit the style of the main part of the page edit 'xhtml11.css'
* To edit the side menu and the banner edit 'layout1.css' and  'layout1.conf'
* To edit the style of the credits page edit css/credits.css and credits.conf
