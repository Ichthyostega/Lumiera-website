This describes the part of the redesign site Lumiera that is a conversion of documents from tiddlywiki to format asciidoc in uWIki.

The documents in tiddywiki were parted in files index.html, backend.html, compatibility.html, renderengine.html, support_library.html, todo.html.  Each of those files contains multiple 'tiddlys' (pages).  A separate file was created for each page in each part.

To structures, folds, names file, are definitive currently:

All files are prefixed with asciidoc-<name part>- , file files are suffix .txt.

The files per part are stored in folds, the name fold is the name part file.  For example, documents from index.html are in [fold name is index] in [files names are asciidoc-<something>.txt].

These two structures are redundant.  The reason for redundancy is to facilitate the processes review, proposals, restructure.  

For review and proposals the folds are structures as an alternative to one fold with hundreds of files.  For restructure, the name files are structures if some or all of the files are put in one fold.  


Actually...not all documents at Tiddlywiki was converted yet, subsequent is a list status of parts:
 index.html  ==  converted
 backend.html == converted
 compatibility.html == converted
 renderengine.html == unconverted -- DO NOT CONVERT -- file is in use, talk with ichthyo
 support_library.html == converted
 todo.html == converted

Notes:
 A part is status converted, better to review the documents (files).  
 A part is status converted partial, once a file is in the fold it is ready for review.
 A part is status unconverted, no files are in the fold, or no one edited this file.


I think all structures (folds, files) in git website/wiki are temporary.  I suggest to use the folds until all documents are format asciidoc.  Processes of review and proposals has commenced.  

To determine how a user should navigate the site in hypertext implies the structure in git.
