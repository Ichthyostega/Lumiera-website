// dynamic impl

Assets are created by a Factories returning smart pointers; the Asset creation is bound to specific use cases and _only available_ for these specific situations. There is no generic Asset Factory.

For every Asset we generate a 'Ident tuple' and a long ID (hash) derived from this Ident tuple. The constructor of the abstract base class +Asset+ takes care of this step and automatically registeres the new Asset object with the AssetManager. Typically, the factory methods for concrete Asset classes provide some shortcuts providing sensible default values for some of the Ident tuple data fields. They may take additional parameters -- for example the factory method for creating +asset::Media+ takes a filename (and may at some point in the future aply _magic_ based on examination of the file  -> LoadingMedia)
