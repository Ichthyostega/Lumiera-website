Use the backend, gmerlin/avdecoder and a Player widget to playback videos. This should be a small application which can open and playback many videos from on instance in parallel. Later on scrubbing for this videos might be supported.

The idea here is to show and measure backend and scheduler performance and beeing a proof of concept for the design. It will run independent of the Proc layer but needs quite some work on the backend to be done.
