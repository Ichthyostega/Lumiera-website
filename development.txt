Development
===========

Lumiera is being built from the ground up, starting with the engine core. The core is not tied to the GUI but just interacts with it via clearly defined interfaces. +
Work on the GUI is just starting out, which makes this a good time to contribute any ideas you might have. Please edit the http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Lumiera/GuiBrainstorming[GUI Brainstorming page].

We use a distributed development model backed by the http://git.or.cz/[git] version control system.

Developers meet monthly on IRC. You can have a look the http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Lumiera/MonthlyMeetings[topics of the next meeting] and to the http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Lumiera/PastMonthlyMeetings[protocols of the past meetings].

How to contribute
-----------------

We want the project being very open. Anyone can just start working on it. Of course he should to communicate what he 
wants to do before starting so that we can coordinate the things. We are also careful about documentation and code 
quality, if anyone can just join and leave his contribution must be maintainable by others. That means everything needs 
to be properly documented and supply tests for the testsuite.

Continous Integration system
----------------------------

We have our own continous integration system running on the development server. This monitors certain repositories,
builds the code and runs the testsuite etc. You can look at the current state at http:/builddrone/table.html and its
root dir (http:/builddrone/) contains the raw build logs too. Builddrone is very much work in progress and we would
like if anyone helps developing it further.
