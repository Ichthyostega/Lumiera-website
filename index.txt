Lumiera
=======

Lumiera is a Free/Open Source Non-Linear Video Editing (NLE) application project for GNU/Linux developed by the
http://cv.cinelerra.org/[CinelerraCV] community. +
It was born as a rewrite of the Cinelerra codebase called Cinelerra3 but it is now an independent project with its own name.

Lumiera is still in an early stage of development. It is not usable yet.


Project objectives
------------------

To create, as a community, a non linear video editing and compositing FOSS application for Linux/Unix/Posix Operating Systems, suitable for professional and quality oriented work, 
building on common open source video, sound and GUI toolkits and libraries, providing flexibility and a high degree of configurability and full control of all parameters, but at the same time a smooth workflow which scales well to larger and more complicated editing projects.
