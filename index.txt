What you can do to help
-----------------------

Help edit the site! This breaks down into two categories:

 * Reformatting, updating, and moving existing content
 * Writing new content


Existing content
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many pages are adapted from the original site, or from documents in the 
link:http://git.lumiera.org/gitweb[git] but need editing.

 * The existing content of the old website into a 
   link:{l}/OldWebpage/[separate subdirectory].
 * The results of the *Asciidoc Day* are in Subdirectory 
   link:{l}/Lumiera[/Lumiera]
 * The results of the TiddlyWiki asciidoc-ing can be found in 
   link:{l}/tiddlywiki2asciidoc/[/tiddlywiki2asciidoc]


New Content
~~~~~~~~~~~
Many pages need designing: what they will say, how they will be layed out, 
should this information be abstract and static or dynamic?

See how the site works below.

One goal for the new site is to keep things open a collaborative, so I'm trying 
to include summaries and suggestions for each page.

How can I help?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For information on how to edit pages and contribute:

To learn how to edit the Lumiera website and use git and Asciidoc read
*quickstart*: [link:{l}/quickstart.txt[txt]] and [link:{l}/quickstart.html[html]]
You should look at the txt primarily, and the html to see how Asciidoc looks in html.

To see what needs to be done:

See *todo* [link:{l}/todo.txt[txt]] and [link:{l}/todo.html[html]]
The txt has some hidden/commented sections that are in development because of
Design-Process, if you are not familiar with design-process use the html.

There will also be tickets in trac for certain tasks, so look here:
link:http://issues.lumiera.org/report/15[trac small/non-coding tasks]

To see how the site is strucured read the
*sitemap* [link:{l]/sitemap.html[html]] and [link:{l]/sitemap.txt[txt]]
Note that the todo contains a more detailed and complete version of the actuall
pages of the site and this is primarily for structure.
