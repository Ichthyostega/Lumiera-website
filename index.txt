Lumiera
-------

Lumiera is a Free/Open Source NLE application project for Linux developed by the http://cv.cinelerra.org/[CinelerraCV] community. It was born as a rewrite of the Cinelerra codebase called Cinelerra3 but it is now an independent project with its own name.

Lumiera is still in an early stage of development. It is not usable yet.

Development
-----------

Lumiera is being built from the ground up, starting with the engine core. The core is not tied to the GUI but just interacts with it via clearly defined interfaces. Work on the GUI is just starting out, which makes this a good time to contribute any ideas you might have. Please edit the http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Lumiera/GuiBrainstorming[GUI Brainstorming page].

We use a distributed development model backed by the http://git.or.cz/[git] version control system.

Developers meet monthly on IRC. You can have a look the http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Lumiera/MonthlyMeetings[topics of the next meeting] and to the http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Lumiera/PastMonthlyMeetings[protocols of the past meetings].
