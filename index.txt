<p class="table"><div class="title">Project objectives</div>
To create, as a community, a non linear video editing and compositing FOSS application for Linux/Unix/Posix Operating Systems,
 suitable for professional and quality oriented work, building on common open source video, sound and GUI toolkits and libraries,
 providing flexibility and a high degree of configurability and full control of all parameters,
 but at the same time a smooth workflow which scales well to larger and more complicated editing projects.</p></td>
