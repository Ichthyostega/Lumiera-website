Lumiera
=======

Lumiera is a Free/Open Source Non-Linear Editing (NLE) application project for Linux developed by the http://cv.cinelerra.org/[CinelerraCV] community. + 
It was born as a rewrite of the Cinelerra codebase called Cinelerra3 but it is now an independent project with its own name.

Project objectives
------------------

To create, as a community, a non linear video editing and compositing FOSS application for Linux/Unix/Posix Operating Systems, suitable for professional and quality oriented work, 
building on common open source video, sound and GUI toolkits and libraries, providing flexibility and a high degree of configurability and full control of all parameters, but at the same time a smooth workflow which scales well to larger and more complicated editing projects.
