Existing content
----------------

To start with, I've moved the existing content of the old website into a link:OldWebpage/[separate subdirectory].
And I added in the two example +\*.conf+ and  +\*.css+ files from the asciidoc distribution (Debian/Lenny)

 * the results of the *Asciidoc Day* are in Subdirectory link:Lumiera[/Lumiera]
 * the results of the TiddlyWiki asciidocking can be found in link:tiddlywiki2asciidoc/[/tiddlywiki2asciidoc]


How does this work?
