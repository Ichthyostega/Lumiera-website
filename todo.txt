To-Do List & Page Notes
========================

The todo consists of tasks noted as either:
* *open*: not being worked but needs it, feel free to start work on these
* *pending*: someone is working on it and/or it's mostly complete
* *complete*: basically done, if you feel it needs updating; review any notes first

This todo is built on the link:{l}/sitemap.txt[]
The notes here are to keep track of ideas, check for further notes/ideas on the page

.{l}[]
* index.txt - *Pending*
** Should contain a brief of the project and its status, 
   a general news-feed (likely at bottom) a 'graphic presence' 
   and until complete: info about working on the site

* download.txt *Pending*
** Because their is little for anyone other than developers to work with, 
   this page should contain a brief but friendly explanation of project status, 
   and link to appropriate git, and compiling info

* contribute.txt *Open*
** Describe the various aspects of the project: design/workflow, back-end/proc/gui 
   coding, website, project tools (scripts, etc), testing, maintenance, propaganda. 
   Link to link:{l}/documentation/media/newbies-tutorials.html[Newbies Tutorial]  
   link:http://lumiera.org/gitweb[gitweb] and roadmap, "lumiera from outerspace" etc.

* project/
** index.txt *Pending*
*** Link-ify page to point to references *open*
*** Much more in depth information about Lumiera, its concept, where the 
    project/developers came from (ie Cinelerra) what it can/will do, etc. 
    Should reference some existing documents on these subjects.

** screenshots.txt *Open*
*** Fairly self-explanatory, hopefully I or someone else will be able to write a 
    lightbox (see if css-only is possible) for the time being this will be the 
    current place-holder gui

** press.txt *Open*
*** will be the central point for presenting any 'public' news, propaganda, 
    or media. This includes rss, some ML (to be discussed), logos

** donate.txt *Open*
*** make ffis donation page clear, we need to place a dedicated form or something 
    to make this process easier, as its very confusing 
    (especially if one doesn't speak Deutsch/German)

** roadmap.txt *Complete*
*** Currently links to the trac roadmap, try to integrate the site wrapper to 
    render the trac page with the header and menu of the main site.

** credits.txt *Pending* *Always Open*
*** This is a fairly well written already, but could use some arranging, and 
    integration with site wrapper. Make sure to add your contributions where appropriate

** contact.txt *Open*
*** Can relate to contact on the current site, but we should include some better 
    centralized information on what contacts will help with what info, etc

////
* documentation/ 
** Until the css 3rd level sub-menus are complete /~foodir/index.txt here should 
   have the links in a bar at top or on the side of the page, 
   **also this segment is in a state of change currently because documentation 
   backend is being work on by the dev team**

** index.txt *Open*
*** This a bit of a tricky one. It needs to define and direct users between 
    userdocs, general info (link:{l}/media/[]), technical and design. 
    The index should not be exhaustive, but concise.

      its actual coded or pending code portions. Link to relevant sources.

***** This is a subset in many ways of the GUI, but isn't about the actual GUI itself 

*** model/
**** index.txt *Open*
***** Needs to overview the mdel of lumiera and give links & explanation about 
      the current state, accepted design proposals, suggested proposals and 
      how to write and submit new ones

*** engine/
**** index.txt *Open*
***** Needs to overview the proc and give links & explanation about the

////

* devs-vault/
** index.txt *Open*
*** Cover in brief the various aspects of development and send them on their way,
    should INCLUDE[] the development new-feed (currently news.txt) 

** roadmap *Complete*
*** Currently links to the trac roadmap. (Have link force open in new tab? -BJMR)

////

** design-process/ *Open*
*** This like all documentation above is changing, 
    so nothing has been decided here yet make sure to un-comment link in
    in menu when pending/complete

////

** devs.txt *Open*
*** List of developers (contact info?-BJMR) what they are working on more or less.

** next-meeting/
*** index.txt
**** Document next meeting date/time proposals, and finalized or current time. 
     Also, a short list of what needs to be covered. My intention for the format 
     of this page is to then be modified and converted to recording the 
     discussion during the meeting and what conclusions were arrived at

** past-protocols/
*** Generate a tree like the ML of the minutes/summary/logs of past meetings, 
    in the future use the template derived from next-meeting/index.txt to build 
    a summary and links for the meeting

* links.txt *Pending* *Always Open*
** page list of links related to lumiera

Design & Technical documents from git, moinmoinwiki(pipao), oldsite, ML
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The design documentation is being restructured right now, 
see the ML and IRC for the discussion on this.

*When a clearer picture of the doc is reached this will be updated to reflect/explain that*

////

Existing 
~~~~~~~~~
* The Lumiera/DesignProcess page is quite hard to translate into asciidoc.
    - most ideas are in development.
    - the lists of proposals are automatically generated by MoinMoinWiki, so they have to be hand-coded.
        > No, they will be auto-generated with asciidoc later. cehteh built a .sh in the dev-vault 

* Do we need to keep the comments in the Final Proposals ?
    > Yes.

* The Lumiera/DesignProcess/AllPluginInterfacesAreInC page can't be wiki-edited :/
* Same for the Lumiera/DesignProcess/CCodingStyleGuide page :/
* Same for the Lumiera/DesignProcess/CodingStyle :/
