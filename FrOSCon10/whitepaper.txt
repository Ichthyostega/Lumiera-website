The Lumiera Project
===================

Draft of a Lumiera Project White paper, also used for a planned speech at FrOSCon 2010


================================================================================
The Lumiera Project is to write a professional video editor for Linux.
Editing a feature film or documentary imposes specific challenges, translating
into the demand to build a more advanced infrastructure, well beyond just
the processing of video data.

Challenges of professional media work
-------------------------------------
+summarise the difference...+

First and second Generation
---------------------------
The first generation of video editing software was driven by the technical challenge
of getting video playback and computer based processing to work reliably. The first
proffessional NLEs where competing with the conventional hardware based workflow of
editing chemical film. Seasoned professionals had to be conviced to give up their
familiar work environment learn to handle a fundamentally different kind of tooling.
Somewhat comparable, 10 years later the first generation of video editing software
for Linux had still to re-create the basic environment for working with video, using
just open source tools.

Meanwhile we face a different situation...

Lumiera Architecture
--------------------
- three layers, not two
- script-driven operation
- orthogonality and configurable operation
- extensible on all levels
- language-neutral bindings

Hardware Trends
---------------
- media resolution still increasing
- hardware acceleration questionable
- ubiquitous networking
- massive parallelism


Project and Community
---------------------
- users _and_ developers
- distributed development model
