= TODO for website =

On Sat Feb 12, 2011, SvenL, skangas and ichthyo met on IRC #lumiera and reviewed
the current state of the staging website, which is expected to become the new
Lumiera website on 1st of March. Below is the list of TODOs we collected.

For putting together this list, we used http://lumiera.pastebin.com/Au3EAc2f[lumiera.pastebin.com] +
From now on, it is checked into the root of the staging repository.
For coordination of work:

- look into IRC
- mark done work as DONE in this list below and push it to the staging repository
- if in doubt, just post a mail to the mailing list

'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

== toplevel and general issues ==


* *DONE*: developers page: short list taken from credits
* credits

  - get the "credits" up-to date
  - *DONE*: bring CSS for credits back
  - maybe update to new table syntax
  
* polish front page / tweak CSS

  - *DONE*: link to About Lumiera

* all pages:

  - set background colour explicitly
  - create a footer with important links and contact

== Project menu ==
* about is fine, just add link to "history corner"
* screenshots: use a thumbnail
* donate:
 
  - *DONE*: move page from old website in
  - *DONE*: bring it up to date, that is delete the mention of last year's conferences ;-)

* press:

  - some content interesting for press folks. Or at least some interesting links
  - *DONE*: link to some existing coverage on the press, like the TuxRadio, or the very 
    old article commenting the project start? http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/126441


== Documentation ==
mostly ok-ish for the launch.
Yet we discovered, that we need a tutorial section, and decided to put that below
+documentation/user/tutorials+. Besides, very technical tips and tricks and howtos
can be put into +documentation/technical/howto+. Details about build dependencies
could go into +documentation/technical/build+

== Download menu ==

* *DONE*: fix broken link
* *DONE*: better wording

== Contribute page ==

* *DONE*: check content
* *DONE*: add a paragraph about joining the mailing list and put that paragraph at the top
* *DONE*: maybe move the "become a developer" to the bottom?
* collect all the scattered *Tutorial* pages and move them to documentation/user/tutorials

== Devs vault ==

* index page: shortly describe what it is: collection of resources relevant for active coders
* as stated above: the active coders get a short entry each on the developers page. later that could be
  an image or some additional voluntary information, just to give the names a "face"
* design process: explain the RfC. We've pasted the description from the old design process page
  but we still need to describe how Cehteh's new admin/rfc.script works. Well.. almost self-explanatory
* *STARTED*: meeting: short description of the purpose of our monthly meetings
  +
  see http://staging.lumiera.org/Lumiera/MonthlyMeetings.txt and http://staging.lumiera.org/documentation/devel/rfc/MonthlyDeveloperMeetingOnIRC.txt

* *DONE*: meeting protocols: move in: http://staging.lumiera.org/Lumiera/PastMonthlyMeetings.txt
