= TODO for website =

* developers page: short list taken from credits
* cedits

  - get the "credits" up-to date
  - bring CSS for credits back
  - maybe update to new table syntax
  
* polish frontpage / tweak CSS

  - link to About Lumiera

* all pages:

  - set background colour explicittly
  - create a footer with important links and contact

== Project menu ==
* about is fine, just add link to "history corner"
* screenshots: use a thumbnail
* donate:
 
  - move page from old website in
  - bring it up to date, that is delete the mention of last year's conferences ;-)

* press:

  - some content interesting for press folks. Or at least some interesting links
  - link to some existing coverage on the press, like the TuxRadio, or the very 
    old article commenting the project start? http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/126441

== Documentation ==
mostly ok-ish for the launch.
Yet we discovered, that we need a tutorial section, and decided to put that below
+documentation/user/tutorials+. Besides, very technical tips and tricks and howtos
can be put into +documentation/technical/howto+. Details about build dependencies
could go into +documentation/technical/build+

== Download menu ==

* fix broken link
* better wording

== Contribute page ==

* check content
* add a paragraph about joining the mailinglist and put that paragraph at the top
* maybe move the "become a developer" to the bottom?
* collect all the scattered *Tutorial* pages and move them to documentation/user/tutorials

== Devs vault ==

* index page: shortly describe what it is: collection of resources relevant for active coders
* as stated above: the active coders get a short entry each on the developers page. later that could be
  an image or some additional voloutary information, just to give the names a "face"
* design process: explain the RfC. We've pasted the description from the old design process page
  but we still need to describe how Cehteh's new admin/rfc.script works. Well.. almsot self-explanatory
* meeting: short description of the purpose of our monthly meetings
  +
  see http://staging.lumiera.org/Lumiera/MonthlyMeetings.txt and http://staging.lumiera.org/documentation/devel/rfc/MonthlyDeveloperMeetingOnIRC.txt

* meeting protocols: move in: http://staging.lumiera.org/Lumiera/PastMonthlyMeetings.txt
