	been busy preparing for conferences. We have been at http://froscon.org/[FrOSCon 2010]

We have been present at http://www.openvideoconference.org/[OVC] and met the OpenVideo community. +

        http://unix.freshmeat.net/projects/nobug[version 201001.1] has just
        been released. This new versions, with lots of improvements (also the
        support for non-Linux systems) is now a requirement for Lumiera. On the
        release there are still some pending bugs meant to be shot down in the
        next few days (just now the testsuite fails). +
_CALL FOR TESTERS_ - We are looking for people using MacOS, BSD, OpenSolaris or
 any other variant of a Unix-ish OS (Posix systems for Windows, Cygwin, SFU,
 ...) available for a short test session over IRC. Volunteers, install _gcc_,
 _git_, _valgrind_ (if supported) and contact _cehteh_ at #lumiera on Freenode.

        You probably haven't noticed that, but a lot of work has been done to
        improve this website. In fact the development of uWiki has proceeded as
        far as making this self extensible minimalistic wiki engine actually
        working, today for the first time. After a time for testing and
        debugging it will eventually be set up for the Lumiera website. You can
        http://uwiki.pipapo.org/_uwiki/form/account_create.html[have a look at
        it], but be aware that currently new users are not  automatically
        allowed to edit.

        for a production release really soon. Some help for testing and
        improving the documentation is still needed.
