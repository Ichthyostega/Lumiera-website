The Support Library contains all tools we need at various places, but by themselves don't defines a subsystem on their own.

These things are:
* <<support-library-Plugins, a Plugin loader>>
* <<support-library-ErrorHandling, ErrorHandling>>
* a wrapper for POSIX Threads
** Thread creation joining and canceling
** <<support-library-LockingPrimitives, Locking primitives like Condition variables and Mutexes>>
* <<support-library-SafeCLib, Some tools and wrapers around the C library>>
* <<support-library-Cuckoo, O(1) hashtable using Cuckoo hashing>>

(... to be continued)
