=== Framerates
Framerates are stored as rational numbers eg. 30000/1001 for NTSC, this representation allows highly precise integer calculations for frames and times.

=== Frames
All calculations in Lumiera are based on frames which is a signed integer type. Together with a Framerate and a starting point, every frame can be exactly located.

=== Time
Time is used only internally in Lumiera, every external representation of time will be converted to frames. Time has a precision of 1 microsecond and is stored in POSIX struct timeval. Time is always handled as absolute time, thus frame addresses map to absolute times, there is at worst a 1us precision jitter but no drift.

==== SMPTE and other Timecodes
will be added on demand, but be frame based, not time based
