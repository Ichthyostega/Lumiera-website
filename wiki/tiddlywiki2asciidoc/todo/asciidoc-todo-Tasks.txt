===  Things which are imminent to do

*task 1 1 0.25* Testsuite: Valgrind suppression file generation, glibc/pthreads leak some memory at the end of the applications, this is ok, we have to integrate this as suppressions into the testsuite, initial work done by cehteh

*task* Testsuite: expected +out:+ and +err:+ should be shell glob or regex lines not exact strings. The output shall be matched against the current +out:+ or +err:+ line, on success the check continues with the actual expected glob, on fail the next glob is tried. When that fails the test is counted as failure.

*task* Testsuite: when no expected +err:+ statements are in a test then stderr, including valgrind reports gets ignored, this is a bug. stderr should be filtered for nobug logging events but everything else should be checked for unexpected output.

*task* Website: asciidoc switchover, git integration, rebuild website on push
