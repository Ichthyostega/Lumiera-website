===  Foundations, not really a milestone yet

We need following in a basically working / mockup state:

* GUI
 - define a outline (most important views and modes)
 - define the foundations for communicating with the lower layers
* Proc layer
 - basic assets, create a clip object _(done)_
 - interface/stub for ConfigQuery subsystem _(done)_
 - add simple clip to EDL/Session, invoke builder
 - build render nodes for very simple session (partly mockups)
 - preliminary support for composite clips (video+audio)
* Backend
 - File backend, caching
 - Serializer
 - Scheduler
* Support Libary
 - Plugin Loader
 - Other tools there
* Infrastructure
 - Testsuite
 - Website

==== Next Goals

. Make a <<todo-video-player-mockup, video player mockup>>
. Integrate a +Version 0.1+ able to
.. load a simple media
.. put a clip to the EDL
.. build the corresponding low-level model
.. run a render process

===  Second round
_all rather brainstorming for now, feel free to modify..._

* save and load session
* integrate YAP Prolog instead of the mock impl
* load and wire some plugins
* send output to a window in GUI
