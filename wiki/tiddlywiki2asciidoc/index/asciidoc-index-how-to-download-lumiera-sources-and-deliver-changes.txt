This part should explain what you have to do in order to download the sources of Lumiera from pipapo.org. It treats as well how to deliver improvements to cin3 using git. Git is a tool similar to cvs or svn.

The cin3 sources are stored in a git repository. Maybe you have never heard of git before, but i can allay your fears: using git isn't that complicated. To download cin3 the very first time you simply have to clone a git-repo from pipapo.org. To do so just type the following in a shell:

[source, shell]
----
git clone git://git.pipapo.org/lumiera/ct YOURCOPY-NAME
----

This will create a directory named +YOURCOPY-NAME+ which contains the whole data of the +lumiera/ct+ branch of Lumiera. After having downloaded a cin3-git-repository you can update it by simply typing:

[source, shell]
----
cd /your/path/YOURCOPY-NAME
git pull
----

If everything went well your copy is now up to date. Pulling is faster than cloning it again and causes less traffic at the server. 

.Tips:
* NEVER delete a git repository without a permission of a pro.
* Check the url.
* Install git before calling git

Now you could compile the source code or improve Lumiera or the documentation. After having done so (let's say you have written a patch) you can deliver your changes by:

* At first setting your name and email
* Committing your changes
* Pushing your local git-repo to a public server

[source, shell]
----
git config --global user.name YOUR-REALNAME
git config --global user.email YOUR-EMAIL-ADDRESS
git commit -m YOUR-DESCRIPTION FILE/TO/COMMIT
git push git://git.pipapo.org/lumiera/mob
----

+lumiera/mob+ is an anonymous account at pipapo.org where everyone can commit changes.
