.Description
* The Application has three Layers: link:backend.html[Backend], link:renderengine.html[Proc-Layer] and GUI
* The Application shall be completely functional without GUI (``headless'', script-driven)
* All IO, media data fetching, processing and bookkeeping falls within the realm of the Backend
* All media object manipulation, deciding and configuration is the Proc Layer's job
* Extensible by plugins on all levels, highly configurable, but not totally componentized (micro kernel) architecture
* Strong separation between high-level and low-level areas of the Application
* The user/GUI manipulates a link:renderengine.html#HighLevelModel[high-level model] whereas rendering is based on a corresponding link:renderengine.html#OverviewRenderEngine[low-level model]
* Stored Session (state) is comprised of high-level model, a collection of link:renderengine.html#Asset[Assets] and accompaning configuration
* (possibly) Several storage backends, abstracted out by a common interface
