*Lumiera* is the emerging professional non linear video editor for Linux

This is the entry point to documents for design and development.  The documents are in groups that correspond to the parts of the application.  All documents are stored in the +GIT+ as format +asciidoc+, hypertext at this site is generated automatically as documents change.  For the future we plan to create a wiki for anyone to edit these developer documents easily.  That redesign is in process as of 2009 09.

* we maintain (semi-) final design docs in <<index-design-documentation, design documentation>>
* Things get often worked out on IRC at server +freenode.net+ channel +lumiera+, see <<index-transcripts-developer-meetings, transcripts>> for protocols, logs, and decisions made there
