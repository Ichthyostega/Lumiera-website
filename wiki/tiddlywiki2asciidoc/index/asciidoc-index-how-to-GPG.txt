I (cehteh) just paste my configs and give very few hints here, refer to the gpg manpage, the gpg documentation, google or ask on IRC for details. Maybe you improve this.

First of all you need to install gpg and generate your keypair if you don't have done that already. generating keys is done with +gpg --gen-key+ refer to the manpage for details.

Be very careful that your private key has a *GOOD* passphrase and be kept secret.

Configuration files are in +~/.gnupg+

Here are the things I have in my +~/.gnupg/gpg.conf+ (there are a lot of comments too, which I leave out here, instead I add some notes as comments)

# enter your keyid AC4F4FF4 is mine!
default-key AC4F4FF4

force-v3-sigs

compress-algo 1

# you can add alternative keyservers
keyserver hkp://subkeys.pgp.net
#keyserver blackhole.pca.dfn.de

# to let gpg automatically download public keys from the net, makes usage much easier
keyserver-options auto-key-retrieve

# using a gpg agent makes usage easier too, but you should only use it on a personal computer
use-agent

when you want to use the gpg agent you need to add following line to your +~/.bash_profile+ to start the agent on login:
----
eval $(gpg-agent --daemon)
----

further you need to add following lines to your +~/.bash_logout+ to stop the agent when logging off:
----
if test &quot;$GPG_AGENT_INFO&quot;; then
        kill -TERM $(echo $GPG_AGENT_INFO | sed -s 's/.*:\(.*\):.*/\1/')
fi
----

further the gpg agent needs some configuration in +~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf+:

Note that I am using very long timeouts, refer to the manual about its implications or leave the defaults.
