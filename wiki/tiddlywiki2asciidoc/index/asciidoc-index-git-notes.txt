// note git

I use some GitAliases to make signing and publishing easier.

The +.git+ dir itself is not versioned/distributed since it usually contains site-specific things. Despite this we might want to distribute some maintenance scripts and hooks so I put the default hooks into +admin/git_hooks/+ and users can symlink from +.git/hooks+ them when needed.

For now I hope this approach suffices, maybe we need +admin/git_hooks/$HOOKNAME.$USER+ at some point when it turns out that people want personal hooks.
