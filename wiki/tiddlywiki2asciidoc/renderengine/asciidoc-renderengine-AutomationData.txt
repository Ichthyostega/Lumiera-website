// def automation

While generally automation is treated as a function over time, defining and providing such a function requires some _Automation Data._ The actual layout and meaning of this data is deemed an implementation detail of the <<renderengine-ParamProvider, parameter provider>> used, but nevertheless an automation data set has object characteristics within the <<renderengine-EDL,EDL (high-level-model)>>, allowing it to be attached, moved and <<renderengine-Placement,placed>> by the user.
