Lumiera is written for GNU/Linux. We try to make the best out of modern system programming techniques to reach the best possible performance. It is suggested to use a 64bit OS. Lumiera shall scale with the provided Hardware, the more RAM and the more/faster CPU's you have the better. Nevertheless lower end 32bit machines are supported too.

Secondary targets will be other free operating systems which offer a decent Posix API. By coincidence it will be possible to port Lumiera to Mac OSX if anyone helps with that.

Windows platforms are not on our target list, if someone wants to do port it, we will merge his efforts but unless that happens we will not care for windows compatibility.
