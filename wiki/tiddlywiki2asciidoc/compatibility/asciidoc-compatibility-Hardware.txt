=== Platform
We work and test on PC hardware, 32 and 64 bit. It is intended that Lumiera runs on other platforms which run GNU/Linux.

=== Graphics
There are no special requirements for the graphic system, using of OpenGL will likely be defined by the single plugins. Anyways it will be strictly optional.

=== Disks
Video editing requires decent disk speed, it is suggested to use a fast/big array of disks configured as raid.

=== Special Hardware
There are currently no plans to add support for propietary hardware accelerator boards. We don't have such hardware and we don't want to tie a free software program to closed hardware. This might change if the benefits are worth it, someone dontates such hardware to the developers, the specs of the hardware and the programming API are open.
