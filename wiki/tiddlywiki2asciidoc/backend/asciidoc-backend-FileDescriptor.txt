+FileDescriptor+ is the superclass of all possible filetypes, it has a weak reference to a <<backend-FileHandle, +FileHandle+>> which is managed in <<backend-FilehandleCache, +FilehandleCache+>>, on creation only the existence (when reading) or access for write for new files are checked. +FileDescriptor+ stores some generic metadata about the underlying file and intended use. But actual opening is done on demand.

The content is memory mapped into the process address space, this is managed by <<backend-FileMap, +FileMap+>> objects and a <<backend-FileMapCache, +FileMapCache+>>.
