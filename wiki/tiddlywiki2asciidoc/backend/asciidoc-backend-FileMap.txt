Each +FileMap+ object contains many <<backend-Frame, +Frame+>>s. The actual layout depends on the type of the <<backend-File, +File+>>. Mappings need to be page aligned while ++Frame++s can be anywhere within a file and dynamically sized.

All established ++FileMap++s are managed in a <<backend-FileMapCache, +FileMapCache+>>. This is similar to the <<backend-FilehandleCache, +FilehandleCache+>>, but mappings which are in use are checked out of the aging list and thus become locked from aging/purging.

+FileMap+ objects are transparent to the application. It will only requests ++Frame++s as in position and size (and some other parameters).
