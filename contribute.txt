Lumiera is an open source, community developed project. +
We need your contributions to get ahead, please join in!


How can you help?
-----------------

The are many ways to help the Lumiera project; joining e.g. the discussion on the
Mailinglist as an expert, maybe investigating some topic of interest -- likewise,
the small contributions are valuable, be it just to fix some spelling or grammar
error on the website. Besides, starting with small contributions is a good way
to familiarise yourself with the way the project works; in doing so, you might
well discover interesting aspects or topics to work on.


Contribute to the Mailing List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The mailing list is the central information hub of the project. Everyone is welcome! +
It is used by the developers for technical discussion but we encourage you to subscribe,
follow the discussions and use it for proposals, technical or user-level questions and any
kind of request concerning Lumiera.  You may also talk to us in real time at our IRC channel
#lumiera on Freenode.

-> contact information link:project/contact.html[Mailing List & IRC]


Help with our website and infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may be aware that we are updating the website and integrating many of the 
Lumiera development tools into it. This takes a bit of work and ingenuity, so 
we need people to work these things out.
Some additional help is greatly appreciated with keeping news up-to-date, 
formatting and editing design documentation, and working on the aesthetics of the 
Lumiera site.


Complete small tasks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We always have small needs and necessities, please check our issue tracker; +
If in doubt, ask on the mailing list.

-> see link:http://issues.lumiera.org/report/15[small/non-coding tasks] in our Trac.


Contribute to the Lumiera design
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The design of Lumiera is being evolved and documented continuously,
see the related link:{ldoc}/design/index.html[design section] of the documentation.
We base the development of the design on **RfC**s; these start out as proposals by developers
or users -- we'll discuss them on the next IRC meeting, work in modifications and finally
accept or drop them...

-> read more about our link:{l}/documentation/devel/rfc.html[RfC system].


Start contributing to the code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Familiarise yourself with Git. Learn how to build from sources. Explore the code.
Lumiera is an open project -- any contribution, small or large, is welcome.

There are portions of the project that require specific knowledge and
experience. Because everyone has different specialities (and likes) we work
together to cover the project's necessities. When you join Lumiera, let us know 
your interests and expertise, there is something for everyone here.


Beginners
^^^^^^^^^^
_Beginners are welcome._ Explaining stuff to others helps _us_ to understand our
own code better. Lumiera is a good place to gain experience and knowledge and we
need people who point out when things become too complicated or documentation is
lacking.

Open Source Attitude
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Working on the design and code shall be as easy and simple as possible for _Doers_. +
_Doers_ are defined by the work they do. There is no application or such to join
the project. It is completely open to anyone. Bring your ideas and insight,
discuss with the other coders, defend and improve your approach, shape
the direction the project takes.

This needs certain knowledge and experience. Anyone may decide if and which
parts of the project (s)he is able to handle. The goal is to work together
where each one adds his best capabilities for the benefit of all.

Sometimes there is tedious work to do, documentation needs writing, boring coding
details demand our full attention -- but everyone shall acknowledge not to block the
project by his actions. Therefore: think first, ask people personally if something
is not understood, try to understand things how they are before arguing about.



How to contribute
-----------------

While anyone can just start working on the project, we'd appreciate if you communicate
your intentions. This helps avoiding wasted efforts. Beyond this, the only real entrance
barrier is to learn working with commandline tools and to set up a work environment.

Basically, everyone works on his own Git repository and merges in any changes done by
other contributors. At times, the core developers will pick up your contributions, review
and accumulate work into the subsystem branch and later into the master branch.
