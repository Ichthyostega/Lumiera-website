Become a Developer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lumiera is an open project, you don't need and application, you can start 
working now.

There are portions of the project that need a lot of specific knowledge and 
experience. Because everyone has different specialties (and likes) we work 
together to cover the project's necessities. When you join Lumiera, let us know 
your interests and expertise, there is something for everyone here.

Beginners
^^^^^^^^^^

Beginners are welcome! Lumiera is a good project to gain knowledge and experience 
with. Also, we need the people who can let us know when something is too 
complicated, or the documentation misses something important.

Open Source Attitude
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

While there is some tedious work to do (coding, documenting your work, git)
please commit to interfere with the work by your actions (or inactions). We are
careful with documentation and code quality, you're free to contribute but make
sure your contributions are maintainable and understandable to others.

So, *Think First*. If something is unclear, ask us personally (irc, email). 
Very often any issues can be resolved right there. Many ideas are well-thought 
out at this point in the project try to read our discussions and reasoning about 
how we go there. If you still don't understand, ask. Just as we are open to ideas 
please also keep an open mind for suggestions.

Resources
^^^^^^^^^^

The project is built with a git repository running a builddrone. We have our own 
continuous integration system running on the development server. This monitors 
certain repositories, builds the code and runs the test suite etc. You can look 
at the current state at http:/builddrone/table.html[] and its
root dir (http:/builddrone/[]) contains the raw build logs too. 

Builddrone is very much work in progress and we would
like if anyone helps developing it further.

To learn about git you can read the link:{l}/quickstart.html[quickstart-html] 
link:{l}/quickstart.txt[txt] Note that this is written for the sitework and just 
an overview of how git works.

Everyone works on his own git, merges with anyone else, at times we decide to 
accumulate work into a master git.

Help with our website and infrastructure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may be aware that we are updating the website and integrating many of the 
Lumiera development tools into it. This takes a bit of work and ingenuity, so 
we need people to work these things out.

Beside writing content for the pages, the major project is implementing uWiki. 
The Lumiera website is designed to 'live' through uWiki, which will provide a web 
interface to edit the whole site. uWiki is in development and needs some attention. 

Some additional help is greatly appreciated with keeping news up-to-date, 
formatting & editing design documentation, and working on the aesthetics of the 
Lumiera site.

Existing content
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Many pages are adapted from the original site, or from documents in the 
link:http://git.lumiera.org/gitweb[git] but need editing.

 * The existing content of the old website into a 
   link:{l}/OldWebpage/[separate subdirectory].
 * The results of the *Asciidoc Day* are in Subdirectory 
   link:{l}/Lumiera[/Lumiera]
 * The results of the TiddlyWiki asciidoc-ing can be found in 
   link:{l}/tiddlywiki2asciidoc/[/tiddlywiki2asciidoc]


New Content
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many pages need designing: what they will say, how they will be laid-out, 
should this information be abstract and static or dynamic?

See how the site works below.

One goal for the new site is to keep things open and collaborative, so I'm
trying to include summaries and suggestions for each page.

How can I help?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For information on how to edit pages and contribute:

To learn how to edit the Lumiera website and use git and Asciidoc read
*quickstart*: [link:{l}/quickstart.txt[txt]] and [link:{l}/quickstart.html[html]]
You should look at the txt primarily, and the html to see how Asciidoc looks in html.

To see what needs to be done:

See *todo* [link:{l}/todo.txt[txt]] and [link:{l}/todo.html[html]]
The txt has some hidden/commented sections that are in development because of
Design-Process, if you are not familiar with design-process use the html.

There will also be tickets in trac for certain tasks, so look here:
link:http://issues.lumiera.org/report/15[trac small/non-coding tasks]

To see how the site is strucured read the
*sitemap* [link:{l}/sitemap.html[html]] and [link:{l}/sitemap.txt[txt]]

Note that the todo contains a more detailed and complete version of the actual
pages of the site and this is primarily for structure.

An explanation of design documentation and rfc's is needed here, bjmr has no idea
what to write

Complete small tasks and favours
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We always have small needs and necessities, please check trac: link:http://issues.lumiera.org/report/15[trac small/non-coding tasks]

And keep up with the mailing list.

How to contribute
-----------------

We want the project being very open. Anyone can just start working on it. Of course he should to communicate what he 
wants to do before starting so that we can coordinate the things. We are also careful about documentation and code 
quality, if anyone can just join and leave his contribution must be maintainable by others. That means everything needs 
to be properly documented and supply tests for the testsuite.

If you want to build the Lumiera GUI from the git source repository have a look at our http://lumiera.org/Lumiera/NewbiesTutorials[Newbie Tutorial].

Idea how to participate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Everyone works on his own git, merges with anyone else, at times we decide to accumulate work into a master git. 

Continuous Integration system
----------------------------

We have our own continuous integration system running on the development server. This monitors certain repositories,
builds the code and runs the testsuite etc. You can look at the current state at http:/builddrone/table.html[] and its
root dir (http:/builddrone/[]) contains the raw build logs too. Builddrone is very much work in progress and we would
like if anyone helps developing it further.

Plan
----

Thus working on the design shall be as easy and simple as possible for _Doers_. _Doers_ are defined by the work they do. There is no application or such to join the project. It is completely open to anyone.

This needs certain knowledge and experience. Anyone may decide if and which parts of the project he is able to handle. The goal is to work together where each one adds his best capabilities for the benefit of all. Beginners are welcome. This is a good place to gain experience and knowledge and we need people who point out when things become too complicated. There is a lot of tedious work to do (documentation, coding), but everyone shall acknowledge not to block the project by his actions. Therefore: think first, ask people personally if something is not understood, try to understand things how they are before arguing about.
