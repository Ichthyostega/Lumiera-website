Lumiera
=======

This is the entry page for the wiki based Lumiera brainstorming.

New to Lumiera? Start here: link:QuickStart[]

*Lumiera* is the name for a project (re)writing a professional video NLE, starting with a feature set and taking an aproach similar to the existing http://cvs.cinelerra.org[Cinelerra-2], but using current toolkits and programming practices in an really open developement process.

 * We develop the Lumiera design in link:DesignProcess[], just take a look.
 * When you have an idea which is not yet ready for a proposal just add it to link:BrainDump[].
  . This is intended to become a rather chaotic lump of ideas to inspire the other Developers.
 * Add Brainstorming and a collection of Ideas for the GUI to this page : link:Lumiera/GuiBrainstorming[].
 * link:MailArchive[] is an archive containing links to useful mail-threads.
 * link:Lumiera/Developers[] and helpers can be found here.
 * Help to improve the collection of link:Links[].
 * We make offical link:MonthlyMeetings[] talking about outstanding issues and future plans.
 * Creating _Free Software_ takes a lot of work and time. When you want to give something back to the Lumiera developers, then check out our link:Donations[] page.
link:Announcement[] send to all developers.


Plan
----

The Lumiera design process should be as open as possible, but time consuming lengthy flame wars and design discussions shall be locked out.

Thus working on the design shall be as easy and simple as possible for _Doers_. _Doers_ are defined by the work they do. There is no application or such to join the project. It is completely open to anyone.

This needs certain knowledge and experience. Anyone may decide if and which parts of the project he is able to handle. The goal is to work together where each one adds his best capabilities for the benefit of all. Beginners are welcome. This is a good place to gain experience and knowledge and we need people who point out when things become too complicated. There is a lot of tedious work to do (documentation, coding), but everyone shall acknowledge not to block the project by his actions. Therefore: think first, ask people personally if something is not understood, try to understand things how they are before argueing about.


Idea how to participate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We start here on the wiki, short lived communication is done on IRC or per personal email. There is no mailinglist by intention! Long lived decisions are documented in this wiki. Final decisions are added to a tiddlywiki inside the git repository. (You can browse a snapshot of this design tiddlywiki link:http://ichthyostega.de/cin3/wiki/index.html[online here])

Everyone works on his own git, merges with anyone else, at times we decide to accumulate work into a master git. I'll (cehteh) provide git mirroring for people who don't have persistent internet connectivity. People may also decide to mirror at _link:http://repo.or.cz[]_


Git Repositories
----------------

Take a look at link:http://www.pipapo.org/gitweb[] and link:http://www.lumiera.org/gitweb[] there are several Lumiera repositories from different people plus an anonymous committable _mob_ repository which you can readily use to submit patches.

The git repos are available under the git-url: `git://git.lumiera.org/$NAME` or `git://git.pipapo.org/lumiera/$NAME` where name is the actual name of the repo like _ct_, _ichthyo_, _mob_ and so on.

Currently there are some git repos named `git://git.pipapo.org/cinelerra3/$NAME` leftover, we are in progress renaming them.
