The Asset Manager provides an Interface to some internal Database holding all Assets in the current Session and System state. It may be a real Database at some point (and for the moment it's a Hashtable). Each <<renderengine-Asset,Asset>> is registered automatically with the Asset Manager; it can be queried either by it's _identification tuple_ or by it's unique ID.
