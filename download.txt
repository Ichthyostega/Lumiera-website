Current Code
-------------

Lumiera is currently under active development.  We are in a pre-alpha
stage, meaning that the software is not usable yet.

However, we have an early GUI draft in place which might give a feel
for what the interface could look like.  It is available for end-user
experimentation now.

Get it!
