Development Version
-------------------

Lumiera is currently under active development. +
We are in a pre-alpha stage, meaning that the software is *not usable yet*.

However, we have an early GUI draft in place which might give a feel
for what the interface could look like.  It is available for end-user
experimentation now, but you need to _build_ it first.


Build it, try it!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use a distributed infrastructure based on *Git* repositories.
To learn how to compile Lumiera from source, you might want to read our tutorial
link:{l}/documentation/user/tutorials/building.html[»Building Lumiera from source«].
Browse, review and download current Lumiera code and more from our various
Git repositories, link:http://www.lumiera.org/gitweb[browsable online here].
