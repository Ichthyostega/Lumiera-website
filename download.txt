Development Version
-------------------

Lumiera is currently under active development. +
We are in a pre-alpha stage, meaning that the software is *not usable yet*.

However, we have an early GUI draft in place which might give a feel
for what the interface could look like.  It is available for end-user
experimentation now, but usually you need to _build_ it first.

Lumiera Debian package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the Lumeira core developers use Debian/stable as a reference system for
development. This has the nice side effect that we'll provide Debian source and
binary packages to reflect the ongoing development. Since Ubuntu is based on
debian, we provide packaging for some Ubuntu distributions as well.

While Lumiera doesn't provide any usable features yet, it can be installed
already through the debian packaging mechanisms. We prepare pre-releases
and build packages on VMs to rehearse the release mechanisms. Thus, if you're using
a Debian/Squeeze (stable) based system _(Doh!)_, or a suitable Ubutu flavour,
you might be able to try out our link:/debian[Debian depot for apt-get].
Please be sure to report any broken dependencies and installation problems.

We use a distributed infrastructure based on *Git* repositories.
To learn how to compile Lumiera from source, you might want to read our tutorial
