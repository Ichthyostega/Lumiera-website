Development Version
-------------------

Lumiera is currently under active development. +
We are in a pre-alpha stage, meaning that the software is *not usable yet*.

However, we have an early GUI draft in place which might give a feel
for what the interface could look like.  It is available for end-user
experimentation now, but usually you need to _build_ it first.

Lumiera Debian package
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some of the Lumeira core developers use Debian/stable as a reference system for
development. This has the nice side effect that we'll provide debian source and
binary packages to reflect the ongoing development. Since Ubuntu is based on
debian, the plan is to extend this gradually to some Ubuntu distributions as well.

For now: if you're using a Debian/Lenny based system on AMD64 _(Doh!)_
you might want to try out our link:/debian[Debian depot for apt-get]


Build it, try it!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We use a distributed infrastructure based on *Git* repositories.
To learn how to compile Lumiera from source, you might want to read our tutorial
link:{l}/documentation/user/tutorials/building.html[»Building Lumiera from source«].
Browse, review and download current Lumiera code and more from our various
Git repositories, link:http://www.lumiera.org/gitweb[browsable online here].

You can find more information about the project on the
