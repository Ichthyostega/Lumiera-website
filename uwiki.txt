uWiki
=====

uWiki is a flexible wiki that among others allows to edit the wiki's code in 
the wiki itself.

uWiki uses http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/index.html[\AsciiDoc] as markup 
language and http://git.or.cz/[git] for revision control.

A prototype with Haserl using Bash has been made but the possibilities
of Haserl have been stretched to its limits.

Now http://www.keplerproject.org/cgilua/[CGILua] has been chosen as the tool to 
develop uWiki further.

Waiting for the uWiki to be usable, this website is temporarily being built with \AsciiDoc and git.
