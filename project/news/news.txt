        http://unix.freshmeat.net/projects/nobug[version 201001.1] has just
        been released. This new versions, with lots of improvements (also the
        support for non-Linux systems) is now a requirement for Lumiera. On the
        release there are still some pending bugs meant to be shot down in the
        next few days (just now the testsuite fails). +
_CALL FOR TESTERS_ - We are looking for people using MacOS, BSD, OpenSolaris or
 any other variant of a Unix-ish OS (Posix systems for Windows, Cygwin, SFU,
 ...) available for a short test session over IRC. Volunteers, install _gcc_,
 _git_, _valgrind_ (if supported) and contact _cehteh_ at #lumiera on Freenode.
