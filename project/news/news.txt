*October 15 2010*::
	*Quick Autumn news*: Last months the Lumiera community have 
	been busy preparing for conferences. We have been at http://froscon.org/[FrOSCon 2010]
	with a booth and a http://programm.froscon.org/2010/events/551.de.html[talk on Lumiera].
      You might want to watch the http://ftp.stw-bonn.de/froscon/2010/hs12/theora/hs12%5F-%5F2010-08-22%5F10%3A00%5F-%5Fde%5F-%5Flumiera%5F-%5Fhermann%5Fvosseler.ogv[video (in german)] from Ichthyo's presentation.
	Besides, we have been present at http://www.openvideoconference.org/[OVC] and met the OpenVideo community. +
	After an intermission caused by other duties, _ichthyo_ is now back working
	on integration of some recently finished parts into the session. The plan
	is then to address topics like output / Jack integration or the builder.
	_cehteh_ is taking a short leave from  
	Lumiera coding. We can't wait to have him back!

        http://unix.freshmeat.net/projects/nobug[version 201001.1] has just
        been released. This new versions, with lots of improvements (also the
        support for non-Linux systems) is now a requirement for Lumiera. On the
        release there are still some pending bugs meant to be shot down in the
        next few days (just now the testsuite fails). +
_CALL FOR TESTERS_ - We are looking for people using MacOS, BSD, OpenSolaris or
 any other variant of a Unix-ish OS (Posix systems for Windows, Cygwin, SFU,
 ...) available for a short test session over IRC. Volunteers, install _gcc_,
 _git_, _valgrind_ (if supported) and contact _cehteh_ at #lumiera on Freenode.
