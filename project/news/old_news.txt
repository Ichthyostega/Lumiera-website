*November 2016*::
      While there’s been a long pause since our last news report,
      a lot of coding activity happened ``behind the scenes''.
      Read more in our recent
      link:/project/news/DevReport-16-11.html[2016 Development Report]...

*November 2015*::
      We published the next »preview release« `0.pre.03` +
      We did a lot of library and platform upgrades recently, which need to be
      reflected within package definitions and buildsystem. This ``release'' is
      relevant for developers only; we still have no user visible changes yet.
      As usual, we upgraded our Debian packaging and rebuilt the package
      on various distributions, to spot build problems
      and verify compatibility...

*August 2015*::
      The reference platform for Lumiera has been upgraded to Debian/Jessie.
      And the Language level has been raised to C++14. As usal, Lumiera
      core developers will meet at and after the
      http://froscon.org[FrOSCon conference].

*May 2015*::
      The existing Lumiera user interface has been switched to GTK-3. +
      Besides some clean-up, this prompted more activities in
      the area of GUI and workflow recently. Read more in the
      link:/project/news/DevReport-15-05.html[2014/15 Spring Coding News...]

*August 2014*::
      Benny has compiled a small
      link:/project/news/DevReport-14-08.html[2014 Summer News Report] --
      As usual, Lumiera team will meet again at the FrOSCon conference
      at Bonn/St.Augustin (Germany)

*May 2014*::
      the Lumiera core developers will visit the
      http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014[LAC Linux Audio Conference] in Karlsruhe/Germany.
      As we did some years ago at Utrecht, we'll help again with the Video streaming. And
      of course we'll use the opportunity for a in-person *developer meeting*.
+
After this conference, Benny Lyons has written the
link:/project/news/DevReport-14-05.html[2014 Spring News Report]

*April 2014*::
      The Lumiera code base has been switched to C\+\+11.
      Additionally, we'll support also compilation with Clang from now on.
      The transition to C++11 didn't impose any serious problems, since we're employing
      a modern coding style right from start. After the switch, development will benefit
      especially from the new features _rvalue references_, _auto type inference_ and
      _constexpr_.

*August 2013*::
      while preparing for FrOSCon, we collected and merged several
      documentation contributions. Thanks to Benny Lyons:
      here is the link:/project/news/DevReport-13-08.html[2013 Summer News Report]

*March 2011*::
      We can now provide link:/debian[binary Debian packages] for the first time,
      allowing you to _install_ a development preview/snapshot without compiling, on
      Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu). But don't get too excited -- you won't
      see any new features on the GUI...

*September 2010*::

        http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/projects/nobug[version 201001.1] has just
        been released. This new version, with lots of improvements (also the
        support for non-Linux systems) is now a requirement for Lumiera. On the
        release there are still some pending bugs meant to be shot down in the
        next few days (just now the testsuite fails).
+
_CALL FOR TESTERS_ - We are looking for people using MacOS, BSD, OpenSolaris or
 any other variant of a Unix-ish OS (Posix systems for Windows, Cygwin, SFU,
 ...) available for a short test session over IRC. Volunteers, install _gcc_,
 _git_, _valgrind_ (if supported) and contact _cehteh_ at #lumiera on Freenode.

        You probably haven't noticed that, but a lot of work has been done to
        improve this website.
////
-- commented out as it never became actually relevant --
        In fact the development of uWiki has proceeded as
        far as making this self extensible minimalistic wiki engine actually
        working, today for the first time. After a time for testing and
        debugging it will eventually be set up for the Lumiera website. You can
        http://uwiki.pipapo.org/_uwiki/form/account_create.html[have a look at
        it], but be aware that currently new users are not  automatically
        allowed to edit.

        out. Lumiera needs this new version from now on. We are on the track
        for a production release really soon. Some help for testing and
        improving the documentation is still needed.
