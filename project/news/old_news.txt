*April 2014*::
      The Lumiera code base has been switched to C\+\+11.
      Additionally, we'll support also compilation with Clang from now on.
      The transition to C++11 didn't impose any serious problems, since we're employing
      a modern coding style right from start. After the switch, development will benefit
      especially from the new features _rvalue references_, _auto type inference_ and
      _constexpr_.

*August 2013*::
      while preparing for FrOSCon, we collected and merged several

*March 2011*::
      We can now provide link:/debian[binary Debian packages] for the first time,
      allowing you to _install_ a development preview/snapshot without compiling, on
      Debian based systems (e.g. Ubuntu). But don't get too excited -- you won't
      see any new features on the GUI...

        http://lumiera.org/nobug_manual.html[NoBug]
        http://unix.freshmeat.net/projects/nobug[version 201001.1] has just
        been released. This new version, with lots of improvements (also the
        support for non-Linux systems) is now a requirement for Lumiera. On the
        release there are still some pending bugs meant to be shot down in the
        next few days (just now the testsuite fails).
+
_CALL FOR TESTERS_ - We are looking for people using MacOS, BSD, OpenSolaris or
 any other variant of a Unix-ish OS (Posix systems for Windows, Cygwin, SFU,
 ...) available for a short test session over IRC. Volunteers, install _gcc_,
 _git_, _valgrind_ (if supported) and contact _cehteh_ at #lumiera on Freenode.

*December 12 2009*::
        You probably haven't noticed that, but a lot of work has been done to
        improve this website. In fact the development of uWiki has proceeded as
        far as making this self extensible minimalistic wiki engine actually
        working, today for the first time. After a time for testing and
        debugging it will eventually be set up for the Lumiera website. You can
        http://uwiki.pipapo.org/_uwiki/form/account_create.html[have a look at
        it], but be aware that currently new users are not  automatically
        allowed to edit.

*September 5 2009*::
        The page about our link:froscon09.html[FrOSCon] appearance is now
        online, still a bit prelimary we work on it.

*September 4 2009*::
        A new http://unix.freshmeat.net/projects/nobug[release] of
        http://lumiera.org/nobug_manual.html[NoBug], our debugging library is
        out. Lumiera needs this new version from now on. We are on the track
        for a production release really soon. Some help for testing and
        improving the documentation is still needed.

*September 3 2009*::
        Mario from http://www.lxde.org/[LXDE] talked with us at FrSOCon. This
        interview is now online at
        http://www.perspektive89.com/2009/lumiera_radio_interview_during_froscon_2009[perspective89] and
