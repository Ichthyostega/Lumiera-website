//Menu: label 21-09 Dev Report


.Introduction
Covid-19 has also affected the Lumiera project as _Ichthyo_ has had a major workload
to bear over the past year in his professional occupation in the financial sector as a developer.
Moreover he continues to devote
time to other projectes such as his contribution to 
http://yoshimi.sourceforge.net/[Yoshimi (soft synthesiser)],
building an acceptance
https://github.com/Ichthyostega/yoshimi-test/[test framework and a test suite]
for Yoshimi and a Blender artwork project. However, modest progress has also been seen in Lumiera.   




Project Activity
----------------



The Timeline View
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Over the past years, we have invested time in the 
https://lumiera.org/documentation/user/intro/intro.html[Timeline View], and last year
was no exception. 

We previously reported on a milestone in being able to send a command from the stage 
layer all the way down to the session. More development work in this area resulted in 
us in succeeding to respond in the session with a structured message to populate the 
UI with such things as tracks, nested tracks, clips and some other widgets. 
Consequently, the UI has taken its very first steps in being able to interact with a 
user. A user can now 'command' something by making some gestures. We plan to extend 
our gesture feature so that editing actions: trim, roll, slide and shuffle are 
provided by a gesture.

 
Commands and Events
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Developers have realised that a thorough and robust history mechanism can be 
implemented by separating events and commands. A command is evoked by a user, which 
might produce one or more events. A command might also produce no event at all.
A flexible history framework will be based on events not on commands. We are now in 
a position to be able to provide a tentative definition of events, which can be refined 
as required in the future. Such a definition will be the of a history framework.
