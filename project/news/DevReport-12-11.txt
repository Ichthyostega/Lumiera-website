Lumiera Autumn Coding Report

//Menu: label 12-11 Dev Report

There's been a long pause since our last developer news report, but this can
better be attributed to less willingness to write these notes rather than lack
of project activity.

.FrOSCon 2012 and the Annual Lumiera Project Meeting
FrOSCon is rapidly beginning to establish itself as the occasion for the Lumiera
annual project get-together.  The project has been represented at the conference
in one or other form over the past several years, so if you'd like to get
together and meet the various individuals involved in the project, you might
consider attending the conference next year.
Originally, we intended to meet up for a couple of days before the conference in
Southern Germany, but this fell through for one organisational reason or
another. It would be great if we managed to get together a few days before (or
after) FrOSCon 2013.

The Lumiera Project was at the conference this year with a Developer Room.
Hermann (aka _Ichthyo_) held a talk on Git, followed by a discussion on Git on the
Saturday and Sunday of the conference.

.Documentation and Website improvements
The conference also proved productive for Lumiera as Hermann and Benny (aka _Benn_)
began reviewing the content of various Lumiera web pages.  Many of the pages
are not finished and have been in a state of _work-in-progress_ for some time
now.  Other pages were found to be lacking in content.  At the conference they
both sat down and been tackling this problem.  Moreover, it was quickly realised that
Asciidoc did not have proficient tools to handle crosslinking.  Moreover,
Lumiera has an abundance of technical jargon and terminology with a very
specialised meaning.  A good glossary is almost a must.  A
link:/documentation/user/intro/Glossary.html[glossary] is also a
good place for developers to explain various new aspects in Lumiera over
traditional thinking: ``this what Lumiera understands of this term''. It was
thus agreed to automate the generation of a glossary among the documentation. +
This work is now in full progress.

.Coding
_Ichthyo_ has continued the work on the player subsystem and related parts
at the connection down to the engine, where the continuous playback, stepping
and shuffling operations need to be translated into time-bound calculation tasks.
The code base has increased considerably since our last news report, however,
there is still limited changes visible to the user. As time permits, M. Fisher
has now been contributing to the GUI for just over a year. He ported some parts
to a never library version and investigated a possible transition to GTK-3.
After an absence of some time caused by other work commitments, Christian
(_cehteh_) has also returned to the project and reworked our automated
build server (``builddrone'')

Lumiera is still plagued by the lack of developers.
In the Spring of this year, Lumiera had a _pro bono_ advertisement
in the link:http://libregraphicsmag.com[Libre Graphics Magazine], an Open Source
magazine devoted to Open Source Graphics.
The advertisement, placed on page 45 of Issue-1.4, ->
link:http://libregraphicsmag.com/files/libregraphicsmag_1.4_lowquality.pdf[pdf low res] ~(19MB)~
http://libregraphicsmag.com/files/libregraphicsmag_1.4_highquality.pdf[high res] ~(456MB)~
was generally
geared towards a call for developers.  The problem of too few developers working
on Lumiera is still a serious concern for the project.
