//Menu: label 11.06 Dev Report


We're a bit behind on our news reports, but here's some catching up for this quarter.

As you might have read in an earlier newsitem a repository has been setup to
provide binary Debian packages of Lumiera. This means you can easily download
and install Lumiera without having to get the source code and compile it
yourself. This should work for all Debian-derived distro's, including Ubuntu. 
What this doesn't mean is that Lumiera's usable yet. Installing Lumiera will
only give you a taste of the GUI as it was when Joel Holdsworth quit working on
it, over a year ago. Yet it's good to see the repository setup for future use,
though an alpha release is not yet around the corner (there's simply too much
work to be done by just the handful of people that's currently devoted to
Lumiera's development).

While preparing this repository Hermann Vosseler (_ichthyo_) took the time to
review all the work that's been put into Lumiera over the past few years. While
examining the codebase (and cleaning occasionally), certain design principles
have been reviewed and rediscussed. He also worked on the design of the Player
subsystem and Engine Interface. Basically the Player will coordinate what actual
calculations to request from the rendering engine, for which purpose (realtime
playback, rendering, background rendering), how these requests can be interupted
when the request itself changes (f.e. when changing playback speed), and how to
deliver this output to a viewer, which can be controlled by the user, by using
transport controls.

Ichthyo also continued to work on the Time/Timecode handling and Frame
Quantisation functions. These are required to handle frame-time relationships while
providing the option to use custom framerate settings at session level, or even for
individual output busses. The basic framework is in place now. Next step is to
connect it to Ardour's timecode widget, and to add drop-frame support.

Short update about the website: this summer we're going to see the new design
for Lumiera's reworked website! Francesco Siddi is working on it. Exciting
stuff. At the meantime preparations are being made for participation in this
year's Froscon. More about that later in the next quarterly news report coming
somewhere this summer...
