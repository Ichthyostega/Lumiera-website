.Introduction
We review the status of the project here.  Traditionally, we present _our_, i.e.,
that of team members, view of the project.  However, from another perspective,
we provide some comments on Lumiera from another source: 
https://www.openhub.net/p/lumiera/[Openhub]:
 - Programming effort of about 30 years
 - 115,094 lines of code 
 - Rated with five stars by 4 people
 - 31% less activity in 2019

So why then less activity over the previous year?  _Ichthyo_ devoted a number of
months pursuing other activities which is reflected in the diminished activity.

Appropriate Nomenclature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'What's in a name?' Juliet says to Romeo in the famous balcony scene of Romeo
and Juliet by Will Shakespeare. Indeed Martin Fowler (aka Uncle Bob) has
considerably more to say about the importance of selecting words to name things
in our code. Modern practice of programming has embraced these ideas and the
importance of this is now widespread.

We've spent considerable time in selecting appropriate vocabulary throughout the
project and we were always unhappy with two serms: _proc_ and _backend_. So
we've renamed these. The _proc_ layer is known as the _steam_ layer, and the
_backend_ layer is known as the _vault_ layer.

The old nomenclature was mis-leading and simply had to go.

We would, of course, be most delighted to hear any comments (or objections) you
might like to make, for example, on our https://www.lumiera.org/contribute.html[mailing list].
