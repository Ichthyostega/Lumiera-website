Coding: Upgrades
----------------
Recent coding activities were largely related to upgrading the language and
support libraries. After we switched to C++11 last year, we were able to address a lot of 
long standing minor technical issues with the help of ``R-Value References'' and ``Variadic Templates''.
Also somewhat helpful was the nice _language support for Closures_ -- which allowed us to get rid of
some custom library based constructs, thereby improving both the readability
and the performance of the code. Prompted by these upgrade activities, a lot of clean-up work was
done all over the place. This kind of work -- not very gratifying in itself-- helps support and
assist further development work. After all, Our code base has reached a significant size.

GTK-3
~~~~~
The Lumiera User Interface is based on the Gimp Tool Kit (GTK). It is one of the major UI technologies for
building user interfaces on Linux and similar systems; the other main contender is the Qt framework.
GTK saw a partially disruptive update and a round of code renovation over the last few years. 
The new version of GTK, version 3, has reached a state that can now be considered stable and mature.
However, all applications based on GTK have to face a significant upgrade either sooner or later.
We were considerably fortunate with our then UI developer, _Joel Holdsworth,_ who used his experience and
involvement in the Inkspace project to inject the Lumiera UI with an advanced technological base.
One major significant contribution was that Lumiera right from the very beginning used the Cairo library
for vector based rendering of the interface. This provident move turned out to save us most of the
pains other projects encounter when they upgrade from GTK-2 to GTK-3. Two years ago, _Michael Fisher_ built
an experimental branch of our UI based on GTK-3 in order to conduct some experiments with a view towards a
generalised UI canvas control. We were then able to build on this work to switch the main library 
with considerably less pain.

Of course, there remained some follow-up work which kept _Ichthyo_ busy well until the end of 2014: On the one hand,
we were able to abandon our old backport of the docking library (GDL) and switch to the C\++ bindings
available for GDL-3 / GTK-3. This upgrade helped us to get rid of some manual resource tracking
done in C previously, replacing it with the automated resource tracking supported by the C++ language,
which resolved several insidious issues related to closing docked and re-ordered windows and toolbars.
Another somewhat tedious work was to port our custom style sheet to CSS. Lumiera used a custom
``dark'' theme based on the Ardour audio workstation software, which also relies on GTK as the UI framework.
Since GTK abandoned the home-grown theming framework and switched to the Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
known from web and JavaScript development, we had to reverse-engineer our custom theming and re-build
it as a CSS stylesheet.


On-going work: Timeline <--> Session connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Another unfortunate ``ripple effect'' of the transition to GTK-3 caused our custom timeline display widget in
the GUI to become defunct. GTK has largely reworked and streamlined event handling; yet our present timeline
code simply does not respond to new events and thus remains stale. Consequently, it was considered to be a good
opportunity to review the current approach we used to render the timeline, which is more or less the
backbone of our interface. It turned out, that -- while just fine for the moment -- the approach we adopted
does suggest a number of problems when confronted with scaling the architecture.
Based on what we have now implemented in the Session, there is still a lot more functionality that has to be hooked
up into the UI. One important facet that requires careful attention is that updates must be pushed up from the
lower layers asynchronously; otherwise the interface will not be ``reactive'' and would suffer sluggish
behaviour. This is a common phenomena in all current application development, and it is well known that the classical,
_data centric_ and _imperative_ programming paradigm causes significant maintenance problems when
turning to parallel and asynchronous programming models. For this very reason, instead of just simply porting
the existing custom timeline widget to the new GTK-events, _Ichthyo_ started to rework this backbone
component. To this end, he adopted a message driven approach: the Session will push up change messages (``diff
messages'') to the UI and the timeline will be organised recursively, so it automatically follows the structure
dictated by the Session, instead of maintaining a ``mirrored UI model'' on its own.


Workflow and User Interaction Design
------------------------------------
By pure coincidence, questions of Interface and Interaction Design saw some recent activity again.
About two years ago, _Christoph Varga_, a film maker from Vienna approached _Ichthyo_ with a 
visionary and innovative proposal concerning the Human-Computer interface with film editing.
Christoph -- like _Ichthyo_ -- considers most present day professional film editing software to be
deficient. This deficiency is less a lack of »features«, but more of a failing as a tool for humans to actually
work with. Incidentally, Christoph is also related to the https://www.apertus.org/[Apertus° AXIOM] project. 
Once Christoph and _Ichthyo_ had met, private communication continued which resulted in a
http://lumiera.org/documentation/design/workflow/InterfaceConcept_Varga.html[Interface Concept]
contribution to Lumiera from Christoph.
The focus of this work is on working style, the arrangement and interplay of functions,
terminology and the mental model of workspace.  This concept covers an area in urgent need of more
thoughtful considerations, beyond just building the interface and engine technology.
