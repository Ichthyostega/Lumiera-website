In Brief
---------

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Hallo Benny...
ich füge hier Kommentare ein und mache Vorschläge zum Text.

Der erste Teil "In Brief" sollte wirklich knapp sein. Hier würde
ich sogar den Begriff "vertical slice" und alle technischen Details
vermeiden. Aus meiner Sicht sind die wichtigesten Infos
<ja, war auch mein Ziel beim Schreiben, aber es kam, leider, was anders bei mir raus>
- increase in developer activity
- strategic decision to carry on
- question "Why" see below
- focus on integration of the engine
- design proved to perform as expected
- first round of integration nears completion
- a second and possible more round(s) will follow

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
This year has seen an
https://openhub.net/p/lumiera/factoids#FactoidActivityIncreasing[increase in
developer activity] in Lumiera.  This can be attributed to a strategic decision
made by the developers in recent years to continue devoting time and energy to
the project. An additional provision has been made to invest significantly more
developer time in the project. The project should also benefit from a slight
shift in focus towards integrating component parts together that were developed
over the past few years which will enable developers to examine and put to the
test many aspects of the Lumiera design itself as originally conceived by the
developers at the project's launch.

While some fine-tuning to the Lumiera design was required, the overall design
(as had been anticipated) proved to perform as originally expected.  The first
round of integration steps is currently drawing to a close.  While work on the
integration of the Render Engine will provide valuable information to
developers, it will also provide a glimpse into progress for potential Lumiera
users.

We have been asked over the previous years -- and indeed the question has been
posed among ourselves -- as to _why continue_ with Lumiera? We discuss the
question below.

As was customary in all of the previous years, some of the developers met in person
and attended the annual https://www.froscon.org/en/[FrOSCon conference] in August.


In Detail
---------
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ANMERKUNG ich denke, wir sollten nun nochmal an die Ziele des Projekts
anknüpfen, um den besonderen Charakter klar zu machen. In den ersten
Jahren wurde ausführlich nach Lösungen gesucht, die insgesammt zusammenpassen
könnten im Hinblick auf die Ziele. Das ist Forschungs-Arbeit, d.h. man
analyiert, baut einen Teil, und analyisert weiter.
Inzwischen sind wir so weit, daß die Konzeption steht und der Weg klar ist.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Right from its very inception, the Lumiera project strived towards professional
and high-quality work.  Here, the term ``professional'' does not
necessarily imply that this work is done in a _commercial setting_ or
_industrial context._ We do, however, wish to convey an attitude or frame of
mind in our approach we make to our work. Professionalism implies _pursuing work with
sincerity and subjecting myself to engaging in its essence and not its goal,
consequence, rewards or any other peripheral aspect associated with it._

This, our work ethics, has direct implications in the field of film editing as
it implies the need or even the necessity to support high resolution data
formats and extended colour spaces. More importantly, the software must be
sufficiently versatile as to be able to adopt itself to new technological
developments and trends. Lumiera has been conceived as a tool for craftspeople,
delivering both reliability in conjunction with flexibility to deliver a film
edit. The user must have the freedom to glide seemlessly from raw material
exploration, then to the phases of building a rough edit, next on to working on
the narration, subsequently followed by compositing and finally to finish up
with fine tuning and grading.  High-quality processing combined with freedom of
choice comes at an expense: increased complexity. One of the golden features of
the Lumiera architectural design is its ability to cope with this complexity 
while still retaining precision.

Anyone familiar with the process of film creation is well acquainted with the
stages and the assoociated requirements and tasks needed to perform them. Any
one of these tasks taken in isolation can be reasonably mastered by modern day
software and hardware. The _real_ challenge is surely the ability to integrate
these various stages in a _seemless_ manner so as to afford the user maximum
leeway and flexibity in combining the building blocks.  The formidable task is
to build such an application as there is no blueprint availble to guide anyone
in how to achieve this. This was the price paid by the Lumiera project. We had
to trudge through a year-long phase of research and prototyping accompanied with
deeper analysis. The nature of this work can be more appropriately described as
an expedition into partially uncharted territory.  Results can not be derived
from first principles alone, many details need to be examined before being able
to establish a vague picture of possibly how things _could_ fit together.

With the recent achievements of connecting the GUI to a flexible and open ended
model description in the Session, this work of _mapping out the design space_ is
gradually nearing an end. A general style and common traits of the solutions
required by Lumiera has emerged:

- the application is composed of self-contained parts, each exhibiting low coupling among one another
- interaction among the self-contained parts is by exchanging messages, asynchronously
- these messages transmit a _symbolic representation_ of structures and metadata
- this symbolic representation allows us to represent domain knowledge using
  declarative rules which contains information on the best way to handle and
  process data

The Vertical Slice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lumiera development to-date was mainly concerned with components: designing
components, building components and delivering components to provide some
definite functionality. With the successful connection between GUI and
Session, we've started using these components as our basic building
blocks to provide some new functionality. The scope of this new functionality
now expands down into the very core of the Render Engine.

The Lumiera developer news report from last year reported extensively on our
intention to implement a
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_slice[vertical slice].
There, we also described our reasons for doing this, 
link:{l}/project/news/DevReport-22-08.html[see report,] and have a
link:https://issues.lumiera.org/ticket/1221[tracking ticket.]
Most importantly, a graphical depiction of the vertical and the various
components involved is depicted
link:{ldoc}/devel/draw/VerticalSlice.Playback.svg[here.]

Once finished, this vertical slice will allow a user to start the display of
(pre-defined) video content by _pushing a button_ in the Lumiera GUI.
The implementation has made much progress over the course of the last months. 
Several existing parts of the _player_ were successfully integrated.
Some components were not yet available so we 
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mock_object[mocked] these. Other more crucial
parts playing a vital role in the workings of Lumiera were implemented from
the ground up to allow developers to scrutinize its performance in the vertical
slice, but also in combination with components under development. One such
component was the *Scheduler*.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ANMERKUNG: da wir hier "development news" schreiben, könnten wir etwas genauer darauf
eingehen, warum wir uns entschieden haben, einen Scheduler zu verwenden.
Ehrlich gesagt, ich weiß nicht, was Final Cut oder DaVinci machen, daher
möchte ich mich nicht aus dem Fenster lehnen und behaupten, ein Scheduler
wäre so etwas Einzigartiges...
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Time bound delivery of media data is an important aspect of editing and
playback -- yet, other concerns are of similar importance: the ability to make
optimum use of scarce resources and to complete extended processing in acceptable
time, while retaining some overall responsiveness of the system. And, especially
for the final render, it is tantamount to produce reproducibly correct results
without any glitches, spending whatever time it takes to complete the work.
So the Lumiera Render Engine is bound by several, partially conflicting goals
and sometimes faces a situation where available resources are insufficient.

link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheduling_(computing)[Scheduling] is one
well established solution to handle such a situation smoothly. Work is broken
down into tiny _jobs._ Such jobs can be classified according to various criteria
and combined in order with respect to priority. Limited resources can be used
where it matters most. Moreover, placing a scheduling mechanism into the centre
of the engine opens a way to flexibly adapt to future demands. It is possible to
assign some tasks to dedicated hardware, or to have them dispatched over the net
into a render cluster, all integrated seamlessly with the rest of the
application.

The bulk of the work to implement the scheduler has been completed
link:https://issues.lumiera.org/ticket/1280[see details]. The render nodes
(from the low-level model) are not yet connected, 
but first measurements with mocked render jobs indicated that the new
implementation satisfies necessary time constraints:

Why Continue
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Well, most obviously, we enjoy doing it. However, this does not necessarily
justify devoting a considerable amount of time to pursue such a costly
endeavour---well, at least not for us, the current developers.

We believe that we have a unique ideas and that there is no Open Source project
currently available providing the scope, functionality and
https://lumiera.org/documentation/user/intro/intro.html#_vision[vision] that
embraces the reaches Lumiera perpetuates to provide. We are increasingly being
justified by the slowly emerging features from new code that fortifies these
assumptions.

///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
ANMERKUNG: vielleicht sollten wir hier noch einmal den politischen Aspekt anklingen
lassen: Ein unabhängiges Open-Source Projekt + Zusammenarbeit mit der Community.
Eine Lösung die nicht kommerziellen Interessen unterworfen ist. ?
Die Möglichkeit, in diesem Rahmen die Tools weiter zu entwickeln. ?

Wichtig ist mir, daß hier nicht der Eindruck entsteht, wir müßten uns
für das Projekt entschuldigen oder wir wollten nur spielen.
Wir haben einen Anspruch *und* wir haben bereits viel geleistet.
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

There are of course additional reaons as to why we should wish to continue
developing Lumiera. For example, the _thrill_ factor reminiscent of the feelings
after compiling your first "Hellow World" program; or develping the first
multi-threaded programme and been distraught at its failure to reap any
performance gain after many, many nights of late-night debugging, only to find
the the hardware only has a single core: thrill.  But there other aspects that
should not be overlooked: the project already has a design and many problems
partially resolved in code or well documented that is, or will be of benifit to
the communnity.  We believe, this is significant enough to want to share this
with others.
