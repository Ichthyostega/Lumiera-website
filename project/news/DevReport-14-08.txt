FrOSCon 2014 and the Annual Lumiera Project Meeting
---------------------------------------------------
The link:http://www.froscon.de/en/home/[FrOSCon conference] has become
the defacto annual meeting for the Lumiera community.  It was held this year
on August 23'rd and 24'th in Sankt Augustin, near Bonn in Germany.  Lumiera was
one again represented at the conference with a developer room,
shared with baseflight/multiwii, since _cehteh_ is also active in this
community.

This year our get-together took place after the conference.  Members of the
Lumiera group retired to Karlsruhe, the Black Forest and France where we
rambled, dined and generally had a good time.

.The Code
There is little code progress to report on this time.


Blender
-------
_ichthyo_ has been busy recently.  What initially began as a casual look into
http://www.blender.org/[Blender] has resulted in a contribution to the Blender
code-base, expanding and improving the function for video stabilisation.
For example, films made using a hand-held camera result in picture ``shake''.
Blender has a feature tracking function, which can be (ab)used to measure
and compensate unwanted movements in video frames.
footnote:[You can view the

on this feature at Vimeo]

While this feature will certainly find its way into Lumiera in the (far) future,
_ichthyo_ was quick to assert that the main gain to the Lumiera project is not
so much the feature itself, rather the experience gained in examining the
Blender design and code-base.  The Blender need for a re-design was specially
illuminating and the reasons leading to such a decision.
