Blender
-------
_ichthyo_ has been busy recently.  What initially began as a casual look into
Blender has resulted in a significant contribution to to the Blender code-base
http://www.blender.org/[Blender].  
His contribution centres around picture stability, in particular, stability of
picture instability.

For example, films made using a hand-held camera result in picture 'shake'.  By
using the contribution by _ichthyo_ this can be reduced or even entirely removed.

While this feature will certainly find its way into Lumiera in the (far) future,
_ichthyo_ was quick to assert that the main gain to the Lumiera project is not
so much the feature itself, rather the experience gained in examining the
Blender design and code-base.  The Blender need for a re-design was specially
illuminating and the reasons leading to such a decision.
