//Menu: label 14-08 Dev Report


FrOSCon 2014 
------------
Members of the Lumiera team will be getting together at
http://www.froscon.de/en/home/[FrOSCon 14], which will take place towards
the end of August. All are welcome. We'll have a small developer room again,
shared with baseflight/multiwii, since _cehteh_ is also active in this
community.

The project get-together will continue on into the week after the conference.


Blender
-------
_ichthyo_ has been busy recently.  What initially began as a casual look into
http://www.blender.org/[Blender] has resulted in a contribution to the Blender
code-base, expanding and improving the function for video stabilisation.
For example, films made using a hand-held camera result in picture ``shake''.
Blender has a feature tracking function, which can be (ab)used to measure
and compensate unwanted movements in video frames.
footnote:[You can view the

on this feature at Vimeo]

While this feature will certainly find its way into Lumiera in the (far) future,
_ichthyo_ was quick to assert that the main gain to the Lumiera project is not
so much the feature itself, rather the experience gained in examining the
Blender design and code-base.  The Blender need for a re-design was specially
illuminating and the reasons leading to such a decision.
