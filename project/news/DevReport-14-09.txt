.FrOSCon 2014 and the Annual Lumiera Project Meeting
FrOSCon, link:http://www.froscon.de/en/home/[FrOSCon conference], has become
the defacto annual meeting for the Lumiera community.  It was held this year
on August 23'rd and 24'th in Sankt Augustin, near Bonn in Germany.  Lumiera was
one again represented at the conference with a developer room.

This year our get-together took place after the conference.  Members of the
Lumiera group retired to Karlsruhe, the Black Forest and France where we
rambled, dined and generally had a good time.

.The Code
There is little code progress to report on this time.
