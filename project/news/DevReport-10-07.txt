Lumiera Summer Report

//Menu: label 10.07 Dev Report


Summary of achievements
-----------------------

Hermann Vosseler (_ichthyo_) continued with the effort of shaping the Session API,
the interface which will be used by GUI and scripts to manipulate the session
contents like clips, tracks, effects and sequences.
Besides clean-up of placeholder code this involved implementing some library
facilities for registering an accessing the contained parts in an uniform way.

Moreover, he's currently engaged into the design how to handle the output
destinations within the session. This is a prerequisite for building a player
and viewer components or render parts of the session in a flexible way.

Christian Thaeter (_cehteh_) gave nobug a coverage checker and is currently working
on the backbone of cache and frame indexing, based on a specialised B-tree implementation.

_Lumiera from Outer Space_ is a document that gives an overview of the application 
design, helping people to understand the ideas behind Lumiera and the tools they 
will get to work with. It is aimed for workflow designers and anyone who wants to 
know how Lumiera works in general. The document is still in draft form, but already 
useful. Read the

Stefan Kangas (_skangas_) and Guram Z. Savinov (_savgur_) joined the dev team!
_skangas_ is working on GUI, time widget and time handling lib; _savgur_ is investigating 
jack audio integration with the viewer.

We had some great brainstorming about Transport Controls. One idea stands out: 
The transport controller GUIs become independent GUI elements that can be attached 
to the very things you want to control.

Brian Rytel (_BJMR_) launched brainstorming with a little GUI mock-up incorporating 
the pre-existing GUI ideas already floating around. It was well received, feel free to share your thoughts.

_BJMR_ is working on the content and style of the new website.
