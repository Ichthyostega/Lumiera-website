Most activity in the UI-layer: topological dependency on mouse and widgets  

Introduction
------------
Developers met at Froscon and reflected on project activity over the
previous year.


Extended concepts for user interaction
--------------------------------------

The design of the Lumiera UI is of such fundamental importance that much effort
and care has been devoted to its requirements and design. The UI must support
the user workflow and Lumiera aims to provide a high-quality professional
non-linear video editor. The nature of such a workflow is itself intricate and
complex. Hence, the care and attention.

After consulting  professional video editors it has become apparent that traditional
point-and-click methodology will not rise to the challenge. An entirely new UI
concept is required.

One aspect under scrutiny is the diversity of functionality various widgets on a
typical Lumiera screen will have to support to provide a user with the
plethora of functionality at their finger tips. To support this, a new layer
has been conceptually added between the UI widgets and the user
interaction. Typically, a simple widget can be on or off. The user simply 
``clicks'' the mouse to interact.  More complex interaction is required to
trim or roll or slide a clip. We can think of yet more complex interactions,
such as picking a specific transition and apply it informally to a select number
of junctions in a sequence.

We generalise user interaction with widgets as a _gesture_, ``clicking a mouse''
being one simple instance of an interaction. Yet in general a gesture is comparable
to a sentence of spoken language, insofar there is always a predication, a subject
and possibly some further objects as targets. Once the UI detects the completion
of a gesture, a complex series of events can occur, depending on the gesture received.
To add complexity to diversity, a single gesture can involve a number of different
widgets: a number of gestures can involve a single or several widgets.

To describe and manage user interactions on a higher level, a topological coordinate
system has been devised. It complements the usual addressing within user interfaces,
which is based on pixel coordinates and direct references to widget implementation
objects. Our new topological _UI-Coordinates_ allow do address a location within the
structure of the user interface, e.g. within window 1, in panel A, view B, tab C.
This is the foundation to allow a more systematic navigation of the focus within
the UI. Moreover, such coordinates allow to define rules where to place a new
view, or where to show a property panel.

UI backbone
-----------
[red]#to be written# ...

 - reorganised the top level components within UI layer
 - more sustainable, clearer structure
 - allow for clean start-up and shutdown
 - resolve problems with component access

Helper for component wiring
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
[red]#to be written# ...

 - to support this better structure in the UI backbone...
 - rework improve our existing helpers for component wiring
 - add the ability to expose a service and to pick it up from a not directly connected usage site
 - now use the ``atomics'' from the new C++ language standard to guard component initialisation

Integration
~~~~~~~~~~~

Various components have been integrated together so that we can now issue a command
over the UI bus which is then packaged into a message, received onto a queue and then
dispatched into a different processing thread within the session sub-system. As
a proof of concept, the dummy test command sends a status update back into the
UI, which is transmitted back over the UI bus to effect a status change on a
given widget. This test setup represents the first integration of various
fundamental low-level components to form a complete collaboration cycle
with an action triggered from the UI and a response generated within the
session and pushed back into the UI asynchronously.

This development step is an important milestone in the development process.


Froscon Meet-Up
---------------
The annual developer meet-up at Froscon happened over the last weekend of August.
