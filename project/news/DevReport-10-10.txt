You might want to watch the http://ftp.stw-bonn.de/froscon/2010/hs12/theora/hs12%5F-%5F2010-08-22%5F10%3A00%5F-%5Fde%5F-%5Flumiera%5F-%5Fhermann%5Fvosseler.ogv[video (in German)] from Ichthyo's presentation.

Besides, we have been present at link:http://www.openvideoconference.org/[OVC] and met the OpenVideo community. +
After an intermission caused by other duties, _ichthyo_ is now back working
on integration of some recently finished parts into the session. The plan
is then to address topics like output / Jack integration or the builder.

During the next months, _cehteh_ is taking a short leave from Lumiera coding.
We can't wait to have him back!
