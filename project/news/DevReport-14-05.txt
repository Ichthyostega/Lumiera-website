Linux Audio Conference 2014
---------------------------
The Linux Audio Conference (LAC) 2014 was held at the ZKM in Karlsruhe from the
1'st to the 4'th of May.  For LAC it was a return home to where it all began in
Karlsruhe in 2003.

Some of the Lumiera developers were there helping out with organisation:
_cehteh_, _ichthyo_ and _ibenn_. You might be able to see us peeping through in
http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2014/[this picture].  The conference provided us with
an opportunity to meet up and discuss Lumiera and see old friends from the
world of FOSS Audio.

But the conference itself supplied a crop of ideas to the Lumiera
attendees. Sound is an inherent facet of Lumiera as is video, and the conference
did not fail to reveal its treasures, new trends and food-for-thought.

One such topic was the GUI.

.The GUI
The Lumiera GUI is a challenge.  Initially, there will most likely be one,
dominant GUI although smaller scaled GUIs might also be present which would be
geared towards specialised tasks.

For simple sound processing, one can use a simple GUI-builder, e.g., glade, and
glue a few widgets together: a slider for volume, a file loader and saver, etc.
But as the application becomes more complex, this simple mechanism fails to
allow more complex operations to be intuitively incorporated into the GUI.  Most
developers who have used a GUI-builder have crashed against this wall.  The
level of complexity that a GUI-builder can provide quickly becomes saturated.
The developer soon discovers the necessity of having to write code. This is
something that is well known to many programmers.

As the complexity of the application further increases, more careful planning is
required. At some point, as more complex operations have to be supported by a
graphical user interface, the GUI programmer is going to have to transgress
conventional GUI patters.  A good example of this is Blender.

The Blender GUI is a marvel in itself, but it is not perfect; and it is this
imperfection itself that has led to new insight: things to avoid in the Lumiera GUI. 

Blender offers a unique GUI design that provides the user with an incredible
array of complex functionality.  To do this the designers of Blender had to go
beyond conventional GUIs.

Lumiera is also on the moon when it comes to the GUI. It's a moon inhabited
with all kinds of green little martians, who are all members of the freaky
feature show that the Lumiera GUI is going to have to provide to the user.

At LAC 20014 there was at least one GUI where the programmers were faced with
freaky green specimens and it was thrilling to witness how the programmers went
about solving the issues to present a really interesting GUI even though the
GUI itself was almost a side show.

We got to see a very interesting GUI.


Coding
------
There has been some code development on Lumiera recently.  _ichthyo_ has been
responsible for most code contributions over the past few months.

   *  The Lumiera code-base is almost entirely
    compliant https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C++11[C11 compliant]
   *  Some code restructuring


One of the plagues hitting Lumiera development at the moment is the opaqueness
of coding development to the general user: there's nothing to exhibit.


FroSCon 20014: 23-24 August
---------------------------
http://www.froscon.de/startseite/[FroSCon] is beginning to establish itself as
the defacto annual Lumiera get-together.  This year promises to continue the
slowly emerging tradition of meeting up either before or after the conference.  No
definite plans have been made yet.

FroSCon takes place this year from 23 to the 24 of August, and Lumiera members
and enthusiasts will discuss plans on our regular IRC meetings and on our
mailing list http://www.lumiera.org/project/contact.html.
