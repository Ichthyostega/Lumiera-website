Lumiera Winter Report
=====================
:Date: March 2011

//Menu: label 11-03 Dev Report

Winter is (almost) gone (hopefully). +
collecting some pieces of information for the ``coding news''...

Core Development
----------------
On the concept & planning frontier, last fall Hermann Vo√üeler (_ichthyo_)
concentrated on several aspects of output handling and routing at the session level.
This included writing an initial concept how to handle the ``output designation'' of
a media object, especially when nested sequences are involved. The implementation of
an output mapping element allowed to fill some gaps regarding the flexible
binding of a 'sequence' element both into a 'timeline' or 'virtual clip'.

Stefan Kangas (_skangas_) continued his contribution to the Lumiera GUI. Besides
various fixes and clean-ups in the GUI code, he extracted the *Timecode widget* from
*Ardour* and adapted it for the Lumiera codebase. As next topic, he turned towards
hooking up the first pieces of functionality behind the GUI: adding the ability to
place (dummy) clips on the timeline and looking into how to drag them around.

Prompted by Stefan's work on including the Timecode widget into the Lumiera GUI,
as next topic _ichthyo_ concentrated on time handling and time values and *Timecode
representation* in the model. Here the tricky part is how to represent grid aligned
time values, e.g. *frame quantised time*; as Lumiera doesn't use a single session-wide
fixed frame rate, but rather derives the frame rate from the output to be generated,
building a somewhat more general framework was required.

Infrastructure
--------------
The most obvious improvement is that we finally managed to get the
reworked website structure online. The final rush included some cleanup
of existing text content, adjusting of links and a script solution to
maintain the navigation menu of the website automatically.

Besides that, _ichthyo_ worked on improving the general infrastructure: 
He defined what is necessary to *run* the Lumiera *Application*, either directly
or installed through a package. After implementing the necessary adjustments
for build system and start-up sequence, he defined a *Debian packaging* for
the Lumiera Application.
