Lumiera is free software, available under the terms and conditions of the
GNU General Public License *GPL v2 or above*. GPL is a free, _copyleft_ license
for software and other kinds of works.

== About the source code License ==

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU General
Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all
versions of a program -- to make sure it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to _freedom,_ not _price._ The
General Public License was designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for them if you wish), that you
receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change the
software or use pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you these rights
or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you have _certain
responsibilities_ if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it:
responsibilities to respect the freedom of others. For example, if you
distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass
on to the recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must make sure
that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you must show them these
terms so they know their rights.

Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:

. assert copyright on the software, and 
. offer you this License giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.

For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains that there
is _no warranty_ for this free software. For both users' and authors' sake, the
GPL requires that modified versions be _marked as changed,_ so that their problems
will not be attributed erroneously to authors of previous versions.

Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run modified
versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer can do so. This
is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting users' freedom to
change the software. The systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
products for individuals to use, which is precisely where it is most
unacceptable. Therefore, the version 3 of the GPL was designed to prohibit
the practice for those products. If such problems arise substantially in other
domains, the Free Software Foundation is prepared to extend this provision to
those domains in future versions of the GPL, as needed to protect the
freedom of users.

Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents. States
should not allow patents to restrict development and use of software on
general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to avoid the special
danger that patents applied to a free program could make it effectively
proprietary. To prevent this, the GPL v3 assures that patents cannot be used
to render the program non-free.
