Mailing List
------------

For all kinds of questions, proposals, general as well as technical questions, the
link:http://lists.lumiera.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lumiera[lumiera@lists.lumiera.org] Mailing List
is the right location. Deliberately, this list is both for coders and (prospective) users.
Non-members may post (without link:http://lists.lumiera.org/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo/lumiera[subscribing]),
but such messages will be moderated.

 * our own mailing list archives are available http://lists.lumiera.org/pipermail/lumiera/[on our server].
 * the list is bridged to link:http://dir.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.lumiera.general[Gmane.org], which
   gives you several alternative styles of following the list, e.g. in 
   link:http://blog.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.lumiera.general[blog style] or using your favorite reader
   via the good old link:nntp://news.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.lumiera.general[News:] protocol.
