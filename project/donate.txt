Lumiera is a volunteer project, funded by the community.

Since Lumiera does not have a community of users yet, expenses are paid by the
handful of people devoted to developing and supporting Lumiera. They give their
time for free but also have to pay for server hosting, travel and accommodation
for open video meetings, t-shirts, posters, leaflets and other paper
documentation of the project.

Since October 2009, Lumiera has been associated with the
http://www.ffis.de/[ffis], a German non-profit association for the advancement
of Free Software and Free Information. Notably, ffis can collect donations on
our behalf and manage our funds.

For payment methods see the http://www.ffis.de/Verein/donations.html[ffis donation page].
If you do not specify any project, your donation will support ffis, Free
Software and Free Information in general.

*Please, consider donating to the Lumiera project!*

Thank you!
