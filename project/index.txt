Lumiera: What?
--------------

Lumiera is a free open-source nonlinear editing (NLE) and compositing
application.

On the one hand, it must meet the rigours of a professional
film and video production environment; on the other hand, it must
be flexible enough to satisfy the needs of more modest single-user
equipment. In other words, Lumiera will be scalable.

Two key factors were identified to achieve these ambitious goals:

- a modern design
- the resources of the open-source community

The Lumiera project draws directly on the power of open-source by the major use of
prevailing open-source technologies -- do not re-invent the wheel, and use the
knowledge base provided directly by programmers.


Lumiera: Why?
-------------

There is a serious lack of good video editors in the open-source
community. Indeed, commercial video editors typically exhibit a spectrum of
weaknesses; some are minor, but many are serious.  Many of the design
features of Lumiera are there to avoid the limitations
of currently available video editors.


Lumiera: How?
-------------

Lumiera's design is a flexible, open architecture.  Lumiera is composed of
blocks connected together to form the application. Many of these building
blocks are not *reinvented* by the Lumiera team, but are directly included
into the application as plugins using the wealth of excellent technology already
provided by the open-source community. 

Lumiera is not confined to using only technology from the open-source community,
but uses open-source community person-power: programmers, testers, video users,
etc. In fact, the Lumiera open-source community of volunteers, aka *Luminites*,
is seen as being one of the more important aspects of the project. 

//Scalability




//How it works
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//
//NLE's can be demanding of hardware systems, and have specific requirements for
//the application functions and media handling. Lumiera is developed from the
//ground up, beginning with the core. It is designed so the core of the
//application is not tied to the GUI, and can operate independently.
//
//The core consists of a backend (low-level) and proc-layer (mid-level). Because of 
//the specialised requirements of NLE's, there is some interesting and sophisticated 
//development at this level.
//
//The GUI is the part most users will work with, and is in a state of constant 
//design. Unlike some applications, the GUI for Lumiera isn't a pass-through, but 
//contains many features itself. Specialised track nesting, marker/clip interaction, 
//and "perspectives" that arrange GUI elements for specific video tasks.


Lumiera: Project History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lumiera was born from *CinelerraCV*.  While Cinelerra is held in no small esteem 
by many, it does have a number of flaws. The stock of the Cinelerra code base was
not developed by an open community; this was unfavourably viewed by many.
Moreover, the quality of this code base is questionable at places, and the
architecture was deemed not sufficiently extensible and future-proof.
A number of users started a fork of Cinelerra, called ``Cinelerra-3'',
which quickly developed into a complete re-write of the code base.
Major re-design finally resulted in the birth of an entirely
new project to be called Lumiera.  However, the origins of Lumiera are
deeply rooted in the Cinelerra project.

Lumiera has grown since its emergence as a new project.  Regular developer
meetings, active open-source Community participation and stimulating
communication over the net contribute to form a steadily maturing  project.
