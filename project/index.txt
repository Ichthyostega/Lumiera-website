While the homepage gives an intro to the project website, this should give more

The Emerging NLE for GNU/Linux

What is Lumiera?
-----------------

Lumiera is a Free-Open Source Non-Linear Editing (NLE) application in active 
development by the Lumiera community.

NLE's are video editing applications that work non-destructively (ie don't modify
the source media) and can access and edit any portion of the project instantaneously.

Lumiera is designed to be an advanced NLE, it will have extensive technical and
creative tools, and the architecture to expand its tool-sets. The application is 
developed to be highly modular, future-adaptable, and open.

Some select design elements from Lumiera include: advanced memory and media management, 
optimised & customizable GUI, innovative track grouping/nesting, and timecode support.

How it works
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

NLE's can be demanding of hardware systems, and have specific requirements for 
the application functions and media handling. Lumiera is developed from the 
ground up, beginning with the the core. It is designed so the core of the 
application is not tied to the GUI, and can operate independently.

The core consists of a backend (low-level) and proc-layer (mid-level). Because of 
the specialised requirements of NLE's, there is some interesting and sophisticated 
development at this level.

The GUI is the part most users will work with, and is in a state of constant 
design. Unlike some applications, the GUI for Lumiera isn't a pass-through, but 
contains many features itself. Specialised track nesting, marker/clip interaction, 
and "perspectives" that arrange GUI elements for specific video tasks.

Project History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many GNU/Linux applications for advanced media creation 
(GIMP, Blender & Ardour jump to mind), however there are very few video editing 
projects of a similar level.

This came to the attention of several CinelerraCV community members. While
Cinelerra is the most advanced open-source NLE currently available, it has many 
design compromises, and is not developed in a community fashion.

To address many of these issues, originally a code-base re-write of Cinelerra was
proposed, to be called Cinelerra3. Because of many unique design ideas by the 
developers, a new project was born, Lumiera.

Since then, Lumiera has gone through active design & planning, creation of 
project resources, and is now in active development of the core. Work has also 
been done on the GUI as can be seen in link:{l}/screenshots.html[screenshots].

Currently, Lumiera is updating many of its web resources for increased openness, 
accessibility and to promote involvement in both development and community. We 
are always interested in design thoughts and developers, see
