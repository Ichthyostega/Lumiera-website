The Emerging NLE for GNU/Linux

Lumiera: What?
--------------

Lumiera is a Free-Open Source Non-Linear Editing (NLE) and compositing
application.

On the one hand, the design will have to meet the rigours of a professional
film and video production environment, on the other hand, the design will have
to be flexible enough to satisfy the needs of more modest single-users
equipment. In other words, Lumiera will be scalable.

Two key factors were identified and used to achiever these goals:

Two key factors were identified to achieve these ambitious goals:
   -- a modern design
   -- harvest the resources of the Open Source Community

The design draws directly on the Open Source Community by the major use of
prevailing Open Source technologies---do not re-invent the wheel---and the
knowledge base provided directly by programmers.


Lumiera: Why?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There is a serious lack of good video editors in the Open Source
Community. Indeed commercial video editors typically exhibit a spectrum of
weaknesses; some being minor, many being more serious.  Many of the design
features of Lumiera trace their roots back to the limitations of video editors
currently available.


Lumiera: How?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lumiera's design is a flexible, open architecture.  Lumiera is composed of
blocks, connected all together to form the application. Many of these building
blocks are not *reinvented* by the Lumiera team, but are directly implemented
into the application as plugnins, using the wealth of excellent technology already
provided by the Open Source Community. 

lumiera is not confined to only using technology by the Open Source Community,
but uses Open Source Community person-power: programmers, testers, video users,
etc. In fact, the Lumiera Open Source Commnuity of volounteers, aka *Luminites*,
is seen as being one of the more important aspects of the project. 

//Scalibility




//How it works
//~~~~~~~~~~~~~
//
//NLE's can be demanding of hardware systems, and have specific requirements for
//the application functions and media handling. Lumiera is developed from the
//ground up, beginning with the core. It is designed so the core of the
//application is not tied to the GUI, and can operate independently.
//
//The core consists of a backend (low-level) and proc-layer (mid-level). Because of 
//the specialised requirements of NLE's, there is some interesting and sophisticated 
//development at this level.
//
//The GUI is the part most users will work with, and is in a state of constant 
//design. Unlike some applications, the GUI for Lumiera isn't a pass-through, but 
//contains many features itself. Specialised track nesting, marker/clip interaction, 
//and "perspectives" that arrange GUI elements for specific video tasks.


Lumiera: WhereProject History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Lumiera was born from CinelerraCV.  While Cinelerra is held in no small esteem 
by many, it does have a number of flaws. Cinelerra is not developed by an open
community which was unfavourable viewed by many. This, among other motives,
caused a number of users to fork Cinelerra, quickly developed into a complete
re-write of the code base. Originally, the project was to be titled Cinelerra3,
however, major re-design features finally resulted in the birth of an entirely
new project to be called Lumiera.  However, the original roots of Lumiera are
deeply emerged in the Cinelerra project.

Lumiera has grown since its emergence as a new project.  Regular developer
meetings, active Open Source Community participation and stimulating
commnuication exchange over the net contribute to form a steadily maturing  project.
For exaqmple, the GUI has began to take shape:
