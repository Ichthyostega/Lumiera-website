Lumiera: What?
--------------

The goal of the Lumiera project is to build a free open-source
non-linear video editing and compositing application (NLE).

On the one hand, it must meet the rigours of a professional
film and video production environment; on the other hand, it must
be flexible enough to satisfy the needs of more modest single-user
equipment. In other words, Lumiera will be scalable.

Two key factors were identified to achieve these ambitious goals:

- modern design and methodology
- the resources of the open-source community

The Lumiera project draws directly on the power of collaborative
development and the use of prevailing open-source technologies -- relying
on knowledge documented by the work of other programmers, to avoid solving
problems which have already been solved.


Lumiera: Why?
-------------

There is a serious lack of good video editors in the open-source
community. This is particularly relevant when it comes to handling professional grade
high-resolution image formats. Commercial solutions tend to reduce
freedom of choice in exchange for ``secret sauce'', keeping the user in
the dark about how results are achieved while gravitating towards the walled
garden of subscription models and cloud platforms. Many distinctive
features of Lumiera are provided to overcome the well known limitations
imposed by video editors currently available on the market.


Lumiera: How?
-------------

Lumiera builds upon a flexible and open architecture. It is composed of modular blocks
connected together to form the application that processes data. Lumiera is a tool for
craftspeople, delivering both reliability together with flexibility in
combination to build your film edit and compositing. High-quality processing combined with freedom
of choice however increases complexity -- and, thus, the ability to handle complexity
with precision is one of the tenets found in the Lumiera architecture. Another
pillar in the design is clarity,
transparency of decisions, documentation of choices and the open exchange of ideas
and solutions within the community of volunteers behind this project.

Lumiera: Project History
------------------------

The roots of the project can be traced back to the https://cinelerra-cv.wikidot.com[Cinelerra-CV]
community. While Cinelerra was held in no small esteem by many, it suffers from a number of
limitations, which are nestled deep within the code base. One consequence of this is the difficulty in
expanding its functionality beyond its current set of features.
A number of users started an initiative
called ``Cinelerra-3'' at that time which attempted to rework some of the fundamental parts of
Cinelerra. An in-depth analysis revealed, however, that most aspects of the
application either needed or would substantially benefit from a redesign so as
to aspire to the expectations of users and to engange with contemporary tooling.
This dilemma was met by a drive to develop a new application and a community vote

setteled on a new name: »Lumiera«].
Lumiera has grown and expanded in scope since its emergence as an independent project,
while retaining the core of the original vision. So, technically, Lumiera is not a fork
of Cinelerra, but is developed from scratch, starting with the engine core.
Regular developer meetings, active open-source Community participation and stimulating
communication over the net contributed to form a slowly but steadily maturing project.
