Lumiera: What?
--------------

The goal of the Lumiera project is to build a free open-source
nonlinear video editing and compositing application (NLE).

On the one hand, it must meet the rigours of a professional
film and video production environment; on the other hand, it must
be flexible enough to satisfy the needs of more modest single-user
equipment. In other words, Lumiera will be scalable.

Two key factors were identified to achieve these ambitious goals:

- modern design and methodology
- the resources of the open-source community

The Lumiera project draws directly on the power of collaborative
development and the use of prevailing open-source technologies -- relying
on knowledge documented by the work of other programmers, to avoid solving
problems which are solved already.


Lumiera: Why?
-------------

There is a serious lack of good video editors in the open-source
community. Especially when it comes to handling professional grade
high resolution image formats. Commercial solutions tend to take away
freedom of choice in exchange for ``secret sauce'', keeping the user in
the dark about how results are achieved while gravitating towards the walled
garden of subscription models and cloud platforms. Many of the distinctive
features of Lumiera are there to overcome well known limitations
of currently available video editors.


Lumiera: How?
-------------

Lumiera builds upon a flexible, open architecture. Composed of modular blocks
connected to form the application and process the data, Lumiera is a tool for
craftspeople, offering reliability and flexibility to combine these components to
build your film edit and compositing. High-quality processing combined with freedom
of choice however increases complexity -- and thus the ability to handle complexity
with precision is a tenet of the Lumiera architecture. Another pillar is clarity,
transparency of decisions, documentation of choices and the open exchange of ideas
and solutions within the community of volunteers powering this project.

Lumiera: Project History
------------------------

The roots of the project trace back to the https://cinelerra-cv.wikidot.com[Cinelerra-CV]
community. While Cinelerra was held in no small esteem by many, it does have a number of
limitations, which are deeply rooted in the code base, making it very hard to expand its
capabilities beyond the existing feature set. A number of users started an initiative,
called ``Cinelerra-3'' at that time, attempting to rework some fundamental parts of
Cinelerra. In-depth analysis revealed however that pretty much every aspect of the
application needs a redesign to match expectations, driven by contemporary tooling,
technology and film style.

Accepting this challenge, a new name was selected by community vote. Lumiera has grown
and expanded in scope since its emergence as independent project, while retaining the
core of the original vision.  Regular developer meetings, active open-source Community
participation and stimulating communication over the net contributed to form a slowly
but steadily maturing project.
