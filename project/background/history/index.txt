CAUTION: more contents to be added soon

In this section of the Lumiera website we'll collect some documents
and background informations about the history of the Lumiera project.

Roots of the Project
--------------------
As with many open source projects, it is difficult to determine the
absolute beginnings precisely. There was no ``kick off'' meeting with
some people to decide ``now we'll start writing a video editing software''.
Rather, several of us where using link:http://cinelerra.org[Cinelerra] 
for editing tasks with rather professional quality level. It turned out
that indeed Cinelerra _is_ capable of delivering professional quality,
but users of Cinelerra are constantly facing some more or less serious
problems.
