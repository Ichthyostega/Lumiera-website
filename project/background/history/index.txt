In this section of the Lumiera website we'll collect some documents
and background informations about the history of the Lumiera project.

Roots of the Project
--------------------
As with many open source projects, it is difficult to determine the
absolute beginnings precisely. There was no ``kick off'' meeting with
some people to decide ``now we'll start writing a video editing software''.
Rather, several of us where using link:http://cinelerra.org[Cinelerra] 
for editing tasks with rather professional quality level. It turned out
that indeed Cinelerra _is_ capable of delivering professional quality,
but users of Cinelerra are constantly facing some more or less serious
problems.

While not being part of the long-standing ``Cinelerra-CV'' community
right from start, since 2005 we tried to remedy this situation by
contributing improvements, especially addressing things perceived as
major impediment in our everyday editing work. But, overall, the net
result of these efforts was rather sobering

- first of all, the basic constellation within the Cinelerra-CV project
  isn't encouraging. Judging from past discussions, several forums and
  mailing list archives, the original _upstream_ author(s) -- generally
  only known under the pseudonym ``Heroine Warrior Inc.'' -- seem(s) rather not
  to be interested in a more collaborative working style. Just, from time to
  time, a new _upstream version_ will be ``thrown over the brick-wall'',
  featuring some new and nifty additions, some bugfixes plus some more or less
  serious new quality problems.
+
Fortunately, there was the Cinelerra-CV crew,
which used to merge these _new upstream versions_ into the community's
source control system and then, over the course of the next months,
did a great job in getting the new version into a roughly usable
shape for a larger variety of distributions and configurations.
Some of these improvements where picked up by Heroine Warrior,
some weren't, without any real feedback.
+
But given this overall situation, it is quite understandable that this
long-term Cinelerra-CV crew was rather reluctant towards anything beyond
isolated fixes and small improvements. Because any change, irrespective
of the result, would just add to the increasing amount of differences
to maintain and merge with each new upstream release.

- even ignoring this problem of ``mergeability'', Ichthyo's attempts to
  rectify some of the most time-consuming oddities in the behaviour of
  frequently needed features (transitions, automation, effects, interlacing,
  proxy editing) quickly evolved into disproportionally expensive refactoring
  and reworking projects. At the same time, Cehteh concentrated on the frequent
  deadlocks and crashes. Being an experienced system programmer, he quickly
  spotted the reason -- yet any attempt of fixing the problems would lead
  to ``chainsaw surgery'' all over the place. Seemingly, Cinelerra's
  code base was just resilient towards change and evolution.

The strange year 2007
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I recall 2007 as one of these pivotal years, which -- while featuring rather
few ``news events'' -- still endow some kind of _atmospheric change_ in several
areas of life, both in small and on the large. For the Cinelerra-CV community,
in spring 2007 it became evident that, from the long-standing core contributors,
all but one had left, for one reason or the other (not related to Cinelerra).
The development efforts for the CV-Version basically stalled. Several discussions
on IRC gave the impression that the project as a whole might take another turn.

In May, Cehteh and Ichthyo for the first time had some longer conversations on IRC.
Cehteh showed a ``Cinelerra Guerilla Git repository'' with the official CV-Version
and some of his disruptive changes to rework the asset handling, memory management
and thread locking. He wrote a _Braindump page_ on his personal Wiki, proposing

- to replace Cinelerra's excessive use of threading by a thread pool with precisely
  scheduled, side-effect free frame calculation jobs, optimally using the I/O bandwidth
- to introduce a more stringent module- and plugin system, and then to modularise the
  codebase step by step
- to replace Cinelerra's ``background rendering'' by a frame index and frame cache
- to handle the render pipeline more flexibly, so that every component (Camera,
  Mask, Projector, Effects) can be inserted everywhere
- to switch to a really open distributed project structure, allowing everyone to
  contribute freely. Let just the best merged version win!

Some days later, ill tempered and in a bad mood after yet another frustrating
editing session with Cinelerra, spending most of the time just with re-adjusting
already finished sound work messed up by side effects of further editing, Ichthyo
wrote a rant, peppered with random insults and curses. Herman Robak encouraged
him to rewrite that bluster into a polemic text which can be taken seriously.
The resulting link:CinelerraWoes.html[»Cinelerra Woes«] page caused a surprisingly
strong resonance among the Cinelerra-CV community and quickly led to the proposal
for a gradual reworking of the existing code base to rectify and cure the problems
pinpointed here. Ichthyo condensed that into a project plan with seven milestones,
first to define a solid new tooling and project framework and build some trusted
islands of new code. Starting from there, gradually then the whole source base
could be reworked. On another page, he defined some crucial »best practices«
to complement and support the desired open distributed nature of the new
project.

So, suddenly we found ourselves right in the middle of an exciting new movement
with much momentum, long debates and lots of new ideas -- and, most exciting, it
seemed doable right now and here. Yet we should note that we didn't want to start
a new video editor project -- we didn´t want something different, we wanted a
_better Cinelerra_. Throughout these discussions, it became custom to label it
_the-next-Cinelerra_, or -- since the current Version was '2.1' -- just call it
**Cinelerra-3**. After some weeks, Cehteh wrote a _Project Manifest_ and sent a
link:Cinelerra3Announcement.html[Project Announcement] to the contributors,
the known Cinelerra-CV developers and Cinelerra's original Author
(``Heroine Warrior'' alias ``Jack Crossfire'').
