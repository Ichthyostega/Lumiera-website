This page contains a collection of general background information -- +
usually stuff _the insiders_ know already, but which might be helpful
for new people to understand the rationale and the specific decisions
taken within the project.

NOTE: more contents to be added occasionally

About the history
-----------------
As with many open source projects, it is difficult to determine the
absolute beginnings precisely. There was no ``kick off'' meeting with
some people to decide ``now we'll start writing a video editing software''.
Rather, the initiators of the project were all suffering from some well-known
problems when using link:http://cinelerra-cv.wikidot.com[Cinelerra-CV]...

Development methods and coding standards
----------------------------------------
The *Clean Code* movement evolves around a set of principles and practices
to guide a professional attitude for software developers. The original pages
with extensive explanations are unfortunately written in German.

in English...
