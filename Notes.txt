* The Lumiera/DesignProcess page is quite hard to translate into asciidoc.
    - most ideas are in development.
    - the lists of proposals are automatically generated by MoinMoinWiki, so they have to be hand-coded.
        > No, they will be auto-generated with asciidoc later.

* Do we need to keep the comments in the Final Proposals ?
    > Yes.

* The Lumiera/DesignProcess/AllPluginInterfacesAreInC page can't be wiki-edited :/
* Same for the Lumiera/DesignProcess/CCodingStyleGuide page :/
* Same for the Lumiera/DesignProcess/CodingStyle :/
