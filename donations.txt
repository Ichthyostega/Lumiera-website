Lumiera is a volunteer project, funded by the community.
Since Lumiera has not a community of users yet, expenses are paid by the handfull of people devoted to developing and supporting Lumiera. They give their time for free but also have to pay for server hosting, travel and accomodation for openvideo meetings, t-shirts, posters, leaflets and other paper documentation of the project.

In October 2009 Lumiera became a project associated with the http://www.ffis.de/[ffis], a german non-profit association for the advancement of Free Software and Free Information. Especially, ffis can collect donations on our behalf and manange our funds.

For payment methods see the http://www.ffis.de/Verein/donations.html[ffis] donation page.
If you don't specify any project, your donation will generally support ffis, Free Software and Free Information.

Lumiera community is planning a dev meeting at the http://lac.linuxaudio.org/2010/[Linux Audio Conference] - May 1-4 2010, Utrecht, the Netherlands.
It will be a good opportunity to meet also with other openvideo developers but we need help to cover traveling costs. 

*Please, consider donating to the Lumiera project!*
