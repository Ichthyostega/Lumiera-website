lumiera site map
================

.to do
- autogenerate the site map

== brief

The structure is ordered by visitor priority.  Each item is listed as a page ( suffix is '.txt' ), a fold ( suffix is '/' ),  or a link / unknown ( annotated ). 

as implied in the structure, all pages at lumiera.org start as a text '.txt'.  the text files are writ in code that the program +asciidoc+ transforms to hypertext '.html'.

== annotate site map

the structure is annotated at an item with '    -- text '.

== index.html

all folds/subfolds ( '/' ) have an initial page that loads ( 'index.html' ).  for brievity, only the first level index.html, or any annoted index.html is written in the site map.
