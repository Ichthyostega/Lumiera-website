First of all: this looks very good

Now some annotations:

      * the curves need to be *way* bigger, this could be done with some kind of zoom or a dedicated curve view of course (having the small curves in the effect is good too)

      * The ‘renderpipe’ in lumiera is a graph, effects, decoders, encoders, .. everything. We already (?) agreed to make tracks like trees, a video track with 2 sound channel could be represented this way, but different layouts are possible, yet lumiera will be able to load other projects as subproject into this hierarchical tracks. Thumbnails (for video, waveforms for audio) and compositor/viewer windows are then attached to nodes in this graph (for example you can have two viewers, one showing a track before an effect got applied, another after it got applied). You might notice this ‘tree’ is not sufficient to represent a graph, this needs further tools, I am thinking about some ‘wiring’ over the timeline, kind of patch panel, others want a node editor, finally we like need both :).

      * You showing that effects and tracks are grouped by dashed boxes, which is rather limiting to the layout how you can organize things on screen and how things get wired together, we need some more flexible way for this, also sometimes one wants to see only video or only audio and such.

      * For ergonomic working the (+) and arrows you suggested for dragging are somewhat small, aiming to small screen areas for clicking is no fun, I already find that very inconvenient in cinelerra (hitting and dragging frame borders). One solution would be to make this areas bigger and/or use keyboard modifiers, then the whole effect/track area acts like you nudge the start/end point when dragged together with shift or ctrl or so.

      * You mention ‘composite’ effects, these will be really essential for Lumiera, we plan to implement very basic effects only and more complicated effects will be compiled by stacking some simple effects together. I think using the ‘tree’ feature as mentioned above will be more convenient and orthogonal than make a dedicated composite track.

      * You show that some things (audio) tracks can be hidden, for tree like organization this would be just a tree collapse.
