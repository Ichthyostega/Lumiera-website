link:Lumiera/Developers/SimAV/ideapool/[]GUI-distance is just a draft for a draft for a Lumiera Developer Meeting at the moment


Lumiera's core should be completely independent of the (Graphical) User Interface. This would give several new possibilities which do justify the additional costs in my (SimAV's) opinion. The (G)UI should be a standalone binary, just as the core.

I would suppose that the connection between the core and the GUI is achieved using files or pipes. The UI simply writes plaintext commands to that file / stream and the core reads them, and if there are actions the GUI should react on the core writes his commands to another file / stream which is read by the GUI. 

 * during development the gui can be simulated using *echo* or *cat* or ... and either files containing some prepared commands you are working on or several shell-lines.

 * Lumiera's core can get several GUI's, not only different skins. Of course we first need the core and _one_ useable GUI but as I hope the core will be a really solid rock it might be that as Someone(TM) wants to write a non-professional GUI for hobby camera users having got a strong base... 

 * using *nfs* or *netcat* it should be possible to _disconnect_ the GUI physically from the core, so that even the GUI can be on another Computer than the core, the fileserver, the renderfarm nodes, ...

 * the distribution could go even further: Someone(TM) could write a simple splitter / hub / switch to distribute the whole GUI onto different computers on a network. (If Lumiera gets this feature maybe I (SimAV) would write this splitter / hub / switch myself...)
