=============================

*State*         _Final_

*Proposed by*   link:ct[]
-------------------------------------




CodingStyle
-----------
Define coding style standard which we will use.




Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
We need to agree on some coding style, imo constistency is the most important part with this, no matter which style we use.

See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style[]

.Notes:
* no tabs, use spaces!

.Proposed:
* K&R by ichthyo
* compact and well known
* GNU by cehteh
* imo the best readability (albeit little strange)
* cinelerra might apply as official GNU project someday


Another question: __how to write identifiers?__

.Proposed:
* ichthyo: use link:CamelCase[], start ClassNames upper case and variableNames in lower case. Make all namespaces and package (dir) names completely lowercase




Tasks
^^^^^
* Bouml config to generate this style
* footers (or headers) to configure common editors to use this style by default


Pros
^^^^


Cons
^^^^


Alternatives

Rationale

Conclusion
----------
we agreed on GNU style

Comments
--------
Since link:ct[] called spaces instead of tabs first, we should stick to that. I think all other reasons will lead us to nowhere!

Although I'm used to a BSD/KNF-like coding style I will try the GNU one. After all, the wikipedia page mentions no disadvantages of that style :)


I just proposed K&R because it is widely accepted. Personally, I was never very fond of K&R style, I always prefered putting opening braces
to the left. I never used GNU style until now, but it looks somewhat apealing to me. (btw, ECLIPSE comes with presets for all this styles :-P ).
Anyhow, I can adapt to most any style. The only thing I really dislike is using tabs (with the exeption of database DDLs and CSound files, where
tab are actually helpful) :)
