DataBackend
-----------
Describe the DataBackend functionality.


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
This just starts as braindump, I will refine it soon:

. handle all files lumiera uses at runtime (media, edl, temp data)
. manage filehandles, lumiera might use more more files than available filehandles
. manage temporary data
. do caching
. io will be blocked where the backend tells the core where it can expect the data (not read()/write() like)
. kindof garbage collector
. do prefetching
. no/low latency for the core the prefetcher and other things ensure that data is available in time
. translate any input into a format which the lumiera core understands (demux, decode)
. same for encoding to output formats
. offer a plugin API for encoders/decoders
. maybe network backend for serving data to distributed rendernodes
. can do some load control or management (trigger adaptive rendering if system is idle etc)
. pull based arch

.Notes:
* ichthyo wrote also some ideas on http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Cinelerra/Developers/ichthyo/Cinelerra3/Architecture[Architecture] and a sketch/draft about http://www.pipapo.org/pipawiki/Cinelerra/Developers/ichthyo/Possibilities_at_hand[things possible in the middle layer]
