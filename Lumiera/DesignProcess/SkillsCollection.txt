Skills Collection
-----------------
Make a page where people can tell in which areas they are willing to support others.


Description
~~~~~~~~~~~
Some Page should list different things needed for working on the project and users should attach themself when they offer support for it. This is meant that people who run into problems know who to ask. In contrast this is not meant like these Skill pages on Sourceforge or such. I don't like this rating and posing system. We let people assing themself to skill and not skills to people and there is no rating.

Skills shall be anything which is needed like the tools we use, the code we create etc.



Example
^^^^^^^

.Git
* ct
* j6t

.autotools
* ct

.lumiera/renderpipe
* ichthyo

... shall this contain emails?


Tasks
^^^^^
 * just set this page up .. either on this wiki or in a tiddlywiki which becomes checked into the repo


Pros
^^^^
 * inter developer support and help network


Cons
^^^^
 * privacy concerns, people might not publish what they know or better what they ''not'' know


Alternatives
^^^^^^^^^^^^
...urgs


Rationale
~~~~~~~~~
This only announces where people offer support within the lumiera developer community and is absolutely voluntary.
